10213916	Urocortin and inflammation : confounding effects of hypotension on measures of inflammation .|Urocortin , a newly isolated 40 - amino - acid mammalian peptide homologous to corticotropin - releasing hormone ( CRH ) , activates both CRH type 1 and 2 receptors , but may be an endogenous ligand for CRH receptor type 2 .|Urocortin given systemically inhibited heat - induced paw edema in the rat , and was therefore ascribed anti - inflammatory properties .|We examined the effects of urocortin in the carrageenin - induced subcutaneous inflammation model .|Rats were treated with urocortin 200 ( n = 6 ) or 20 nmol / kg ( n = 6 ) ; inflammatory exudates were reduced by approximately 30 % compared to controls ( n = 7 ) at both doses .|However , since subcutaneous urocortin has been shown to reduce arterial blood pressure , we tested the hypothesis that its antiedema and antiextravasatory effects were secondary to arterial hypotension .|Therefore , we examined the parallel effects of urocortin - and hydralazine - induced hypotension on acute inflammation induced by carrageenin in the rat .|Rats were treated with subcutaneous carrageenin and control injections ( n = 8 ) , carrageenin and urocortin ( 20 nmol / kg , n = 9 ) , or carrageenin and intraperitoneal hydralazine ( 10 mg / kg , n = 8 ) .|Mean arterial blood pressure was measured hourly for 7 h in 12 animals , and after 2 h , the nadir of treatment , in a further 13 animals .|Rats were then sacrificed , and the inflammatory exudate volume and leukocyte count were measured .|Mean exudate volumes were reduced from 4 . 8 + / - 0 . 5 ml ( controls ) to 2 . 4 + / - 0 . 3 ml ( p = 0 . 004 ) and 2 . 9 + / - 0 . 6 ml ( p = 0 . 007 ) in urocortin - and hydralazine - treated animals , respectively .|Urocortin and hydralazine both produced a significant fall in blood pressure compared to controls , with mean arterial pressure 2 h after carrageenin injection falling to 51 . 0 + / - 4 . 1 ( p < 0 . 001 ) and 34 . 6 + / - 4 . 6 ( p < 0 . 001 ) vs .|92 . 9 + / - 3 . 7 mm Hg in controls , respectively .|A significant positive correlation was noted between blood pressure and inflammatory exudate volume ( r = 0 .|52 , p = 0 . 007 ) .|As both hydralazine and urocortin lowered blood pressure and inflammatory exudate volume , we suggest that the anti - inflammatory effects of urocortin and related neuropeptides may be nonspecific , acting through hypotension rather than through direct anti - inflammatory mechanisms .|The use of inflammatory models which rely on extravasation may be inappropriate for the study of substances that produce hypotension .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	64-65	51-52	1392	corticotropin - releasing hormone|CRH|CRH|CRH	Gene	27:32:37:51	31:33:38:52	1:1:1:1	D004487	edema	Disease	64	65	2	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	64-65	56-57	7349	Urocortin|Urocortin|Urocortin|urocortin|urocortin|urocortin|urocortin|urocortin|urocortin|Urocortin|urocortin|urocortin	Gene	0:13:56:83:97:139:173:207:337:347:455:473	1:14:57:84:98:140:174:208:338:348:456:474	0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7:10:11:15:15	D004487	edema	Disease	64	65	2	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	27-31	7-8	1392	corticotropin - releasing hormone|CRH|CRH|CRH	Gene	27:32:37:51	31:33:38:52	1:1:1:1	D007022	hypotension|hypotension|hypotension|fall in blood pressure|hypotension|hypotension	Disease	7:163:179:354:483:512	8:164:180:358:484:513	0:5:6:11:15:16	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	13-14	7-8	7349	Urocortin|Urocortin|Urocortin|urocortin|urocortin|urocortin|urocortin|urocortin|urocortin|Urocortin|urocortin|urocortin	Gene	0:13:56:83:97:139:173:207:337:347:455:473	1:14:57:84:98:140:174:208:338:348:456:474	0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7:10:11:15:15	D007022	hypotension|hypotension|hypotension|fall in blood pressure|hypotension|hypotension	Disease	7:163:179:354:483:512	8:164:180:358:484:513	0:5:6:11:15:16	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	27-31	11-12	1392	corticotropin - releasing hormone|CRH|CRH|CRH	Gene	27:32:37:51	31:33:38:52	1:1:1:1	D007249	inflammation|inflammation|inflammation|inflammation	Disease	2:11:90:182	3:12:91:183	0:0:3:6	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	2-3	0-1	7349	Urocortin|Urocortin|Urocortin|urocortin|urocortin|urocortin|urocortin|urocortin|urocortin|Urocortin|urocortin|urocortin	Gene	0:13:56:83:97:139:173:207:337:347:455:473	1:14:57:84:98:140:174:208:338:348:456:474	0:1:2:3:4:5:6:7:10:11:15:15	D007249	inflammation|inflammation|inflammation|inflammation	Disease	2:11:90:182	3:12:91:183	0:0:3:6

10533957	Lipolysis is an important determinant of isoproterenol - induced myocardial necrosis .|The cardiotoxic effect of isoproterenol ( ISO ) is associated with , and possibly due to , calcium overload .|Prior work suggests that calcium entry into cardiac myocytes after ISO administration occurs in two phases : an early rapid phase , followed by a slow phase beginning about 1 hour after ISO injection , leading to a peak myocardial calcium level after about 4 hours .|We have tested the relationship of these phases to myocardial necrosis ( MN ) by determining the time after ISO administration at which the commitment to MN occurs .|This was done by administration of propranolol at various times before and after ISO .|In addition , since ISO induces lipolysis , and lipids can be toxic , experiments were conducted to determine if adrenergically - activated lipolysis could play a significant role in ISO - MN .|We found that propranolol protected the myocardium equally well when administered anytime within 2 hours of ISO injection , but had no effect when given 4 hours after ISO .|This showed that metabolic events taking place more than two hours after ISO injection are required for ISO - MN .|As expected from prior work , there was a small and consistent amount of propranolol - resistant ISO - MN .|Lipolysis , assessed by measuring serum glycerol levels , increased to tenfold above base line at one hour after ISO administration and returned to near basal levels at 4 hours .|Potentiation of lipolysis by intravenous injections of phospholipase A2 ( PLA2 ) or lipoprotein lipase ( LPL ) to rats treated with ISO substantially augmented MN .|Propranolol completely blocked the increase in necrosis produced by PLA2 when given with ISO .|Lipases induced only minimal necrosis in the absence of ISO .|Administration of adenosine ( an anti - lipolytic agent ) , oxfenicine ( an inhibitor of mitochondrial palmitoyl carnitine transferase ) , or vitamin C ( an anti - oxidant ) resulted in a 55 - 60 % reduction in MN .|These results suggest that critical necrosis - determining events occur between 2 and 4 hours after ISO administration and imply a relationship between ISO - induced lipolysis , calcium influx , and ISO - MN .|We hypothesize that importance of lipolysis as a determinant of ISO - MN is related to the generation of free fatty acids , their oxidized / metabolic products , or direct damage to plasma membrane .	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	285-286	276-277	4023	lipoprotein lipase|LPL	Gene	273:276	275:277	10:10	D009202	myocardial necrosis|myocardial necrosis|MN|MN|MN|MN|MN|MN|MN|MN|MN	Disease	9:88:91:105:155:206:227:285:353:389:403	11:90:92:106:156:207:228:286:354:390:404	0:3:3:3:5:7:8:10:13:14:15	1:GDA:2	R2L	CROSS	293-294	276-277	4023	lipoprotein lipase|LPL	Gene	273:276	275:277	10:10	D009336	necrosis|necrosis|necrosis	Disease	293:306:360	294:307:361	11:12:14	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	273-275	13-14	4023	lipoprotein lipase|LPL	Gene	273:276	275:277	10:10	D066126	cardiotoxic	Disease	13	14	1

10702401	Association of EWS - FLI1 type 1 fusion with lower proliferative rate in Ewing 's sarcoma .|The Ewing 's sarcoma ( ES ) family of tumors , including peripheral neuroectodermal tumor ( PNET ) , is defined genetically by specific chromosomal translocations resulting in fusion of the EWS gene with a member of the ETS family of transcription factors , either FLI1 ( 90 - 95 % ) or ERG ( 5 - 10 % ) .|A second level of molecular genetic heterogeneity stems from the variation in the location of the translocation breakpoints , resulting in the inclusion of different combinations of exons from EWS and FLI1 ( or ERG ) in the fusion products .|The most common type of EWS - FLI1 fusion transcript , type 1 , is associated with a favorable prognosis and appears to encode a functionally weaker transactivator , compared to other fusion types .|We sought to determine whether the observed covariation of structure , function , and clinical course correlates with tumor cell kinetic parameters such as proliferative rate and apoptosis , and with expression of the receptor for insulin - like growth factor I ( IGF - 1R ) .|In a group of 86 ES / PNET with defined EWS - ETS fusions ( 45 EWS - FLI1 type 1 , 27 EWS - FLI1 non - type 1 , 14 EWS - ERG ) , we assessed proliferation rate by immunostaining for Ki - 67 using MIB1 antibody ( n = 85 ) , apoptosis by TUNEL assay ( n = 66 ) , and IGF - 1R expression by immunostaining with antibody 1H7 ( n = 78 ) .|Ki - 67 proliferative index was lower in tumors with EWS - FLI1 type 1 than those with non - type 1 EWS - FLI1 , whether analyzed as a continuous ( P = 0 . 049 ) or categorical ( P = 0 . 047 ) variable .|Logistic regression analysis suggests that this association was secondary to the association of type 1 EWS - FLI1 and lower IGF - 1R expression ( P = 0 . 04 ) .|Comparing EWS - FLI1 to EWS - ERG cases , Ki - 67 proliferative index was higher in the latter ( P = 0 . 01 , Mann - Whitney test ;

12631109	Preemptive ramipril therapy delays renal failure and reduces renal fibrosis in COL4A3 - knockout mice with Alport syndrome .|BACKGROUND : Alport syndrome ( AS ) is a common hereditary cause of end - stage renal failure in adolescence due to defects in type IV collagen genes .|Molecular genetics allows early diagnosis , however , no preventive strategy can be offered .|Using the COL4A3 - / - mouse , an animal model for human AS , we evaluated therapy with ramipril in mice .|METHODS : One hundred and twenty - two Alport - mice were treated with 10 mg / kg / day ramipril added to drinking water .|Proteinuria , serum - urea and lifespan were monitored .|Renal matrix was characterized by immunohistochemistry , light - and electron microscopy , and Western blot .|RESULTS : Untreated COL4A3 - / - mice died from renal failure after 71 + / - 6 days .|Early therapy starting at four weeks of age and continuing to death delayed onset and reduced the extent of proteinuria .|Uremia was postponed by three weeks in treated animals .|Lifespan increased by more than 100 % to 150 + / - 21 days ( P < 0 . 01 ) .|In parallel , decreased deposition of extracellular matrix and lessened interstitial fibrosis as well as reduced amounts of renal transforming growth factor - beta1 ( TGF - beta1 ) could be demonstrated .|Late therapy starting at seven weeks decreased proteinuria , however , lifespan did not increase significantly .|CONCLUSIONS : The results indicate an antiproteinuric and antifibrotic nephroprotective effect of ramipril in COL4A3 - / - mice is mediated by down - regulation of TGF - beta1 .|This effect in mice is enhanced by initiation of therapy during pre - symptomatic disease .|The data in COL4A3 - / - mice as an animal - model for Alport syndrome suggest that ramipril might as well delay renal failure in humans with AS .|Early diagnosis and preemptive treatment also may be crucial in humans .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	276-277	222-224	1285	COL4A3|COL4A3|COL4A3|COL4A3|COL4A3	Gene	11:65:142:276:311	12:66:143:277:312	0:3:7:13:15	D005355	interstitial fibrosis	Disease	222	224	11	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	231-236	222-224	7040	transforming growth factor -

alpha ( + 252A / G ) genotypes showed statistically significant differences between patients and the reference group .|The proportion of individuals carrying the LT - alpha 1 / 1 genotype was significantly lower in the group of patients with chronic periodontitis ( 0 . 8 % ) than in the control group ( 8 . 8 % ) ( P < 0 . 0094 , Pcorr < 0 . 05 ) .|However , the significant differences in the frequencies of the combined genotypes ( TNF - alpha and LT - alpha ) between the control and the patient groups were found using a simulation by applying the Monte - Carlo method ( P < 0 . 01 ) .|CONCLUSION : Our data suggest that combined genotypes composed of the TNF - alpha and LT - alpha gene polymorphisms may influence the susceptibility to chronic periodontitis .|We also showed that , comparing the two genes , the 1 / 1 genotype of the NcoI polymorphism in the first intron of the LT - alpha gene is a more informative marker and it may be one of the protective genetic factors against chronic periodontitis in our population .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	52-54	10-13	4049	lymphotoxin - alpha|lymphotoxin alpha|LT -

14521605	Identification of a novel point mutation in platelet glycoprotein Ibalpha , Gly to Ser at residue 233 , in a Japanese family with platelet - type von Willebrand disease .|BACKGROUND : Interaction between platelet glycoprotein ( GP ) Ibalpha and von Willebrand factor ( VWF ) has critical roles in both physiological hemostasis and thrombosis .|Platelet - type von Willebrand disease ( plt - VWD ) is a congenital bleeding disorder characterized by gain - of - function mutations of GPIbalpha .|To date , two mutations in GPIbalpha , G233V and M239V , have been reported in four unrelated families with plt - VWD .|OBJECTIVE : The present study aimed to determine whether G233S of GPIbalpha , a new mutation observed in plt - VWD patients , causes the plt - VWD phenotype and to examine whether conversions to other residues at this position affect VWF binding .|PATIENTS AND METHODS : The propositus was a 3 - year - old Japanese male .|He displayed bleeding symptoms and moderate thrombocytopenia .|His brother was similarly affected .|Platelets from both patients were analyzed by ristocetin - or shear - induced platelet aggregation .|DNA sequencing was performed to analyze the GPIbalpha sequence .|We examined the 125I -

C , and activated matrix metalloproteinase - 9 , factors already implicated in human PAH .|Finally , assessment of steady state mRNA showed that whereas expression of ET ( B ) receptors was decreased in MCT ( sl / sl ) rat lungs , ET ( A ) receptor expression increased .|CONCLUSIONS : Deficiency of the ET ( B ) receptor markedly accelerates the progression of PAH in rats treated with MCT and enhances the appearance of cellular and molecular markers associated with the pathobiology of PAH .|Collectively , these results suggest an overall antiproliferative effect of the ET ( B ) receptor in pulmonary vascular homeostasis .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	10-13	2-5	1910	endothelin B receptor	Gene	10	13	0	D001157	occlusive neointimal lesions|occlusive neointimal lesions	Disease	2:55	5:58	0:1	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	334-337	55-58	3371	tenascin -

16255050	Evidence for common genetic control in pathways of inflammation for Crohn 's disease and psoriatic arthritis .|OBJECTIVE : Clinical , pharmacologic , and epidemiologic evidence supports the hypothesis that common genetic pathways may underlie inflammatory diseases .|In a previous study , a Crohn 's disease gene , CARD15 , was demonstrated to be associated with psoriatic arthritis ( PsA ) .|Recently , a functional haplotype of 2 single -

2 . 41 , uncorrected P = 0 . 005 ) .|In addition , the haplotype associated with Crohn 's disease was also associated with PsA ( P = 0 . 001 ) .|No association was detected in the cohort with psoriasis alone or in the cohort with undifferentiated inflammatory arthritis .|CONCLUSION : The OCTN haplotype previously associated with Crohn 's disease is also associated with PsA , suggesting that these 2 diseases may share some common genetic control in pathways of inflammation .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	229-230	202-204	64127	CARD15|CARD15|CARD15	Gene	49:135:229	50:136:230	2:6:9	D001168	inflammatory arthritis|inflammatory arthritis	Disease	202:324	204:326	7:12	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	202-204	104-105	6583	SLC22A4|SLC22A4	Gene	88:104	89:105	3:4	D001168	inflammatory arthritis|inflammatory arthritis	Disease	202:324	204:326	7:12	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	245-246	202-204	6584	SLC22A5|SLC22A5	Gene	90:245	91:246	3:10	D001168	inflammatory arthritis|inflammatory arthritis	Disease	202:324	204:326	7:12	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	135-136	111-113	64127	CARD15|CARD15|CARD15	Gene	49:135:229	50:136:230	2:6:9	D001172	rheumatoid arthritis	Disease	111	113	4	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	111-113	104-105	6583	SLC22A4|SLC22A4	Gene	88:104	89:105	3:4	D001172	rheumatoid arthritis	Disease	111	113	4	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	111-113	90-91	6584	SLC22A5|SLC22A5	Gene	90:245	91:246	3:10	D001172	rheumatoid arthritis	Disease	111	113	4	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	49-50	44-47	64127	CARD15|CARD15|CARD15	Gene	49:135:229	50:136:230	2:6:9	D003424	Crohn 's disease|Crohn 's disease|Crohn 's disease|Crohn 's disease|Crohn 's disease|Crohn 's disease|Crohn 's disease	Disease	10:44:97:125:181:292:335	13:47:100:128:184:295:338	0:2:3:5:7:11:13	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	104-105	97-100	6583	SLC22A4|SLC22A4	Gene	88:104	89:105	3:4	D003424	Crohn 's disease|Crohn 's disease|Crohn 's disease|Crohn 's disease|Crohn 's disease|Crohn 's disease|Crohn 's disease	Disease	10:44:97:125:181:292:335	13:47:100:128:184:295:338	0:2:3:5:7:11:13	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	97-100	90-91	6584	SLC22A5|SLC22A5	Gene	90:245	91:246	3:10	D003424	Crohn 's disease|Crohn 's disease|Crohn 's disease|Crohn 's disease|Crohn 's disease|Crohn 's disease|Crohn 's disease	Disease	10:44:97:125:181:292:335	13:47:100:128:184:295:338	0:2:3:5:7:11:13	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	49-50	35-37	64127	CARD15|CARD15|CARD15	Gene	49:135:229	50:136:230	2:6:9	D007249	inflammation|inflammatory diseases|inflammation	Disease	8:35:358	9:37:359	0:1:13	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	88-89	35-37	6583	SLC22A4|SLC22A4	Gene	88:104	89:105	3:4	D007249	inflammation|inflammatory diseases|inflammation	Disease	8:35:358	9:37:359	0:1:13	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	90-91	35-37	6584	SLC22A5|SLC22A5	Gene	90:245	91:246	3:10	D007249	inflammation|inflammatory diseases|inflammation	Disease	8:35:358	9:37:359	0:1:13	1:GDA:2	R2L	CROSS	229-230	191-192	64127	CARD15|CARD15|CARD15	Gene	49:135:229	50:136:230	2:6:9	D011565	psoriasis|psoriasis	Disease	191:316	192:317	7:12	1:GDA:2	R2L	CROSS	191-192	104-105	6583	SLC22A4|SLC22A4	Gene	88:104	89:105	3:4	D011565	psoriasis|psoriasis	Disease	191:316	192:317	7:12	1:GDA:2	R2L	CROSS	245-246	191-192	6584	SLC22A5|SLC22A5	Gene	90:245	91:246	3:10	D011565	psoriasis|psoriasis	Disease	191:316	192:317	7:12	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	229-230	227-228	64127	CARD15|CARD15|CARD15	Gene	49:135:229	50:136:230	2:6:9	D015535	psoriatic arthritis|psoriatic arthritis|PsA|PsA|PsA|PsA|PsA|PsA|PsA	Disease	14:57:60:123:145:227:252:299:342	16:59:61:124:146:228:253:300:343	0:2:2:5:6:9:10:11:13	1:GDA:2	R2L	CROSS	123-124	104-105	6583	SLC22A4|SLC22A4	Gene	88:104	89:105	3:4	D015535	psoriatic arthritis|psoriatic arthritis|PsA|PsA|PsA|PsA|PsA|PsA|PsA	Disease	14:57:60:123:145:227:252:299:342	16:59:61:124:146:228:253:300:343	0:2:2:5:6:9:10:11:13	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	252-253	245-246	6584	SLC22A5|SLC22A5	Gene	90:245	91:246	3:10	D015535	psoriatic arthritis|psoriatic arthritis|PsA|PsA|PsA|PsA|PsA|PsA|PsA	Disease	14:57:60:123:145:227:252:299:342	16:59:61:124:146:228:253:300:343	0:2:2:5:6:9:10:11:13

10A / G gene had no significant differences between the healthy group and the control group ( P > 0 . 05 ) .|Levels of CRP , TNF - alpha , CH50 and C3 of ESRD patients with IL - 10A / A genotype were significantly higher than those of ESRD patients with G / G and G / A genotype ( P < 0 . 05 ) , while IL - 10 and Alb were significantly lower ( P < 0 . 01 ) .|The production of IL - 10 in serum from patients with IL - 10A / A genotype was significantly lower than that of patients with G / G and G / A genotype ( P < 0 . 01 ) .|The incidence rate of AS of patients with IL - 10 - 1082A / A genotype was significantly higher than that of patients with G / G and G / A genotype ( P < 0 . 01 ) .|The raise of AS incidence rate was correspondent with the decline of serum IL - 10 and raise of serum CRP and Fib .|CONCLUSION : The IL - 10A / A genotype is a predictable factor of microinflammatory state and high AS incidence rate in ESRD patients .|We use IL - 10G / G genotype to modulate the high production of serum IL - 10 , to decline inflammatory reaction and to keep away from microinflammation and AS in ESRD patients .|We should work hard on improving the dialysis membrane to reduce the anti - inflammatory factors in uremia for chronic renal failure patients with high arteriosclerosis risk .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	150-151	140-141	1401	CRP|CRP|CRP	Gene	150:237:399	151:238:400	3:5:8	D001161	arteriosclerosis|microinflammatory state and arteriosclerosis|AS|AS|arteriosclerosis|AS|AS|AS|AS|arteriosclerosis	Disease	32:73:78:112:140:343:382:421:458:488	33:77:79:113:141:344:383:422:459:489	0:1:1:2:2:7:8:9:10:11	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	164-165	140-141	213	Alb|Alb|Alb	Gene	164:190:286	165:191:287	3:3:5	D001161	arteriosclerosis|microinflammatory state and arteriosclerosis|AS|AS|arteriosclerosis|AS|AS|AS|AS|arteriosclerosis	Disease	32:73:78:112:140:343:382:421:458:488	33:77:79:113:141:344:383:422:459:489	0:1:1:2:2:7:8:9:10:11	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	347-350	343-344	3586	interleukin -

16507146	Cytokine polymorphisms influence treatment outcomes in SLE patients treated with antimalarial drugs .|Antimalarial agents have been widely used as disease - modifying antirheumatic drugs in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus ( SLE ) and other rheumatological diseases , although their mechanism of action has not yet been fully defined .|It is known , however , that effective response to treatment is variable among patients .|Thus , the identification of genetic predictors of treatment response would provide valuable information for therapeutic intervention .|The aim of the present study was to analyze the effect of antimalarial treatment on tumor necrosis factor ( TNF ) alpha serum levels and evaluate the possible influence of TNFalpha and IL - 10 functional genetic polymorphisms on the response to antimalarial drugs .|To this end , TNFalpha serum levels were quantified in 171 SLE patients and 215 healthy controls by ELISA techniques and polymorphisms at positions - 1 , 082 and - 308 of the IL - 10 and TNFalpha gene promoters were determined by PCR amplification followed by hybridization with fluorescent - labeled allele - specific probes in 192 SLE patients and 343 matched controls .|Data were related to clinical features and treatment at the time of sampling and during the course of the disease .|Results showed a significantly higher amount of serum TNFalpha in the entire SLE population compared with controls .|However , TNFalpha serum levels correlated negatively with the use of antimalarial treatment during at least three months before sampling .|Patients under single or combined treatment with these drugs had TNFalpha serum levels similar to healthy controls , whereas untreated patients and those under corticosteroid or immunosuppressive therapies had increased amounts of this cytokine .|This suggests , however , that antimalarial - mediated inhibition of TNFalpha was only significant in patients who were genetically high TNFalpha or low IL - 10 producers .|In addition , evaluation of SLE patients administered antimalarial drugs for three or more years who did not require any other specific SLE treatment indicates that patients with the combined genotype low IL - 10 / high TNFalpha are the best responders to antimalarial therapy , developing mild disease with a good course under this treatment .|In conclusion , we proposed that an antimalarial - mediated downregulation of TNFalpha levels in SLE patients is influenced by polymorphisms at IL - 10 and TNFalpha promoters .|Our results may thus find important clinical application through the identification of patients who are the most likely to benefit from antimalarial therapy .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	118-121	37-39	3586	IL - 10|IL - 10|IL - 10|IL - 10|IL - 10	Gene	118:164:315:352:399	121:167:318:355:402	4:5:10:11:12	D004194	rheumatological diseases	Disease	37	39	1	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	101-104	37-39	7124	tumor necrosis factor|TNF ) alpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha	Gene	101:105:116:135:168:225:237:266:302:312:357:389:403	104:108:117:136:169:226:238:267:303:313:358:390:404	4:4:4:5:5:7:8:9:10:10:11:12:12	D004194	rheumatological diseases	Disease	37	39	1	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	399-402	392-393	3586	IL - 10|IL - 10|IL - 10|IL - 10|IL - 10	Gene	118:164:315:352:399	121:167:318:355:402	4:5:10:11:12	D008180	SLE|systemic lupus erythematosus|SLE|SLE|SLE|SLE|SLE|SLE|SLE	Disease	6:29:33:142:189:229:325:342:392	7:32:34:143:190:230:326:343:393	0:1:1:5:5:7:11:11:12	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	392-393	389-390	7124	tumor necrosis factor|TNF ) alpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha|TNFalpha	Gene	101:105:116:135:168:225:237:266:302:312:357:389:403	104:108:117:136:169:226:238:267:303:313:358:390:404	4:4:4:5:5:7:8:9:10:10:11:12:12	D008180	SLE|systemic lupus erythematosus|SLE|SLE|SLE|SLE|SLE|SLE|SLE	Disease	6:29:33:142:189:229:325:342:392	7:32:34:143:190:230:326:343:393	0:1:1:5:5:7:11:11:12

16824064	Interleukin - 8 gene polymorphism associated with susceptibility to non - cardia gastric carcinoma with microsatellite instability .|BACKGROUND AND AIM : Gastric carcinoma ( GC ) with microsatellite instability ( MSI ) exhibits clinicopathological characteristics distinct from microsatellite - stable ( MSS ) GC .|Both MSI and MSS carcinomas are mostly associated with chronic gastritis infected by Helicobacter pylori ( Hp ) .|The relationship between Hp - induced inflammation and the mutator pathway of MSI remains unclear .|Recently , cytokine polymorphisms have been reported to affect the development of non - cardia GC .|The objective of this study was to elucidate the relationship between cytokine polymorphisms and MSI phenotypes .|METHODS : In a case - control study including 482 controls and 181 patients with GC , interleukin ( IL ) - 8 - 251 , IL - 1B - 511 , IL - 1RN , and tumor necrosis factor - A ( TNFA ) - 857 polymorphisms were genotyped .|The presence of MSI and mutations in exons 5 to 8 of the p53 gene were examined in GC cases .|All clinicopathological data were collected from individual records .|RESULTS : High and low frequency of MSI ( MSI - H and MSI - L ) and MSS were detected in 16 ( 8 . 8 % ) , 14 ( 7 . 7 % ) and 151 ( 83 . 4 % ) GC cases , respectively .|We found that IL - 8 - 251 T / T genotype was significantly associated with increased risk of MSI - H GC compared to MSI - L / MSS GC and controls .|We found no association between other cytokine polymorphisms and MSI - H GC .|The percentage of smokers and the frequency of p53 mutations were significantly lower in MSI - H than MSI - L / MSS GC .|We found significant associations of MSI - H with synchronous or metachronous multiple occurrence , antral location and intestinal type .|CONCLUSIONS : Our study shows that MSI - H GC is associated with IL - 8 - 251 T / T ( low expression genotype ) and is inversely correlated with cigarette smoking .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	31-32	31-32	5928	MSI|MSI|MSI|MSI|MSI|MSI - L	Gene	31:77:112:169:203:209	32:78:113:170:204:212	1:3:5:7:9:9	C536652	MSI|MSI|MSI|MSI|MSI|MSI -

) .|3 .|The assessment of haemostasis parameters levels and ACE activity in effect of treatment with perindopril in relation to ACE gene I / D polymorphism .|MATERIAL AND METHODS : The study involved 78 male divided on two groups : cases and controls .|The cases contained 44 male outpatients ( 25 - 38 years old ) with untreated essential hypertension without clinical feature of coronary heart disease and 34 age - and gender - matched healthy controls .|CONCLUSION : 1 .|Untreated essential hypertension predisposes to the procoagulant state characterised by increased Fb level and suppressed of fibrinolysis .|These changes not depend on ACE gene I / D polymorphism .|The left ventricular hypertrophy not intensificates the procoagulant state .|2 .|The treatment with perindopril decreases blood pressure effectively independent of ACE gene I / D genotype and left ventricular hypertrophy .|Perindopril impairs RAS activity , most in patients with ACE gene II genotype .|The treatment with perindopril is only partially effective in alleviating the procoagulant state , by reducing fibrinogen level in II homozygotes due to its more potent inhibitory action on the RAS in this group .|The treatment makes fibrinolysis better mainly to high t - PA levels , independently of ACE gene I / D polymorphism .|3 .|Left ventricular hypertrophy not differentiates the response on treatment in relation to haemostasis parameters and RAS , however there was a slight decrease in ACE activity in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy .|4 .|The changes in haemostasis system and ACE activity , observed during treatment , suggest the appearance of positive relation between haemostasis and RAS .|Probably the antithrombotic act of perindopril is more pronounced in II genotype group .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	236-237	195-198	1636	ACE|angiotensin converting enzyme I|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE|ACE	Gene	5:72:77:138:149:236:265:285:340:373:390	6:76:78:139:150:237:266:286:341:374:391	0:2:2:6:6:11:14:15:17:19:21	D003327	coronary heart disease	Disease	195	198	8	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	306-307	195-198	2244	fibrinogen|fibrinogen	Gene	28:306	29:307	2:16	D003327	coronary heart disease	Disease	195	198	8	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	333-336	195-198	5327	tissue plasminogen activator ( t -

17151092	Chemopreventive anti - inflammatory activities of curcumin and other phytochemicals mediated by MAP kinase phosphatase - 5 in prostate cells .|As inflammation emerges as a risk factor for prostate cancer ( PCa ) , there is potential for chemoprevention by anti - inflammatory agents .|Dietary phytochemicals have been shown to have chemopreventive properties which may include anti - inflammatory activities .|In this study , we demonstrate a role for mitogen - activated protein kinase phosphatase - 5 ( MKP5 ) in mediating anti - inflammatory activities of the phytochemicals curcumin , resveratrol and [ 6 ] - gingerol .|We utilized the cytokines tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( TNFalpha ) and interleukin ( IL ) - 1beta to increase p38 - dependent nuclear factor kappa - B ( NFkappaB ) activation and expression of pro - inflammatory genes cyclooxygenase - 2 ( COX - 2 ) , IL - 6 and IL - 8 in normal prostatic epithelial cells .|MKP5 over - expression decreased cytokine - induced NFkappaB activation , COX - 2 , IL - 6 and IL - 8 in normal prostatic epithelial cells , suggesting potent anti - inflammatory activity of MKP5 .|Pretreatment of cells with a p38 inhibitor mimicked the results observed with MKP5 over - expression , further implicating p38 inhibition as the main activity of MKP5 .|Curcumin , the phytochemical found in turmeric , up - regulated MKP5 , subsequently decreasing cytokine - induced p38 - dependent pro - inflammatory changes in normal prostatic epithelial cells .|Resveratrol and [ 6 ] - gingerol , phytochemicals present in red wine and ginger , respectively , also up - regulated MKP5 in normal prostate epithelial cells .|Moreover , we found that PCa cell lines DU 145 , PC - 3 , LNCaP and LAPC - 4 retained the ability to up - regulate MKP5 following curcumin , resveratrol and [ 6 ] - gingerol exposure , suggesting utility of these phytochemicals in PCa treatment .|In summary , our findings show direct anti - inflammatory activity of MKP5 in prostate cells and suggest that up - regulation of MKP5 by phytochemicals may contribute to their chemopreventive actions by decreasing prostatic inflammation .	1:GDA:2	R2L	CROSS	22-23	12-17	11221	MAP kinase phosphatase -

based population .|Haplotypes were estimated for each gene using the EM algorithm , and empirical p values were obtained for a logistic regression - based score test , adjusted for significant covariates .|An interaction model between maternal and offspring genotypes was also evaluated .|The most significant findings for association with PE were COL1A1 ( p = 0 . 0011 ) and IL1A ( p = 0 . 0014 ) for the maternal genotype , and PLAUR ( p = 0 . 0008 ) for the offspring genotype .|Common candidate genes for PE , including MTHFR and NOS3 , were not significantly associated with PE .|For the interaction model , SNPs within IGF1 ( p = 0 . 0035 ) and IL4R ( p = 0 . 0036 ) gave the most significant results .|This study is one of the most comprehensive genetic association studies of PE to date , including an evaluation of offspring genotypes that have rarely been considered in previous studies .|Although we did not identify statistically significant evidence of association for any of the candidate loci evaluated here after adjusting for multiple testing using the false discovery rate , additional compelling evidence exists , including multiple SNPs with nominally significant p values in COL1A1 and the IL1A region , and previous reports of association for IL1A , to support continued interest in these genes as candidates for PE .|Identification of the genetic regulators of PE may have broader implications , since women with PE are at increased risk of death from cardiovascular diseases later in life .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	416-418	367-368	1277	COL1A1|COL1A1	Gene	209:367	210:368	7:11	D002318	cardiovascular diseases	Disease	416	418	12	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	416-418	270-271	3479	IGF1	Gene	270	271	9	D002318	cardiovascular diseases	Disease	416	418	12	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	416-418	379-380	3552	IL1A|IL1A|IL1A	Gene	218:370:379	219:371:380	7:11:11	D002318	cardiovascular diseases	Disease	416	418	12	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	416-418	279-280	3566	IL4R	Gene	279	280	9	D002318	cardiovascular diseases	Disease	416	418	12	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	416-418	252-253	4524	MTHFR	Gene	252	253	8	D002318	cardiovascular diseases	Disease	416	418	12	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	416-418	254-255	4846	NOS3	Gene	254	255	8	D002318	cardiovascular diseases	Disease	416	418	12	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	416-418	232-233	5329	PLAUR	Gene	232	233	7	D002318	cardiovascular diseases	Disease	416	418	12	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	414-415	367-368	1277	COL1A1|COL1A1	Gene	209:367	210:368	7:11	D003643	death|death	Disease	47:414	48:415	1:12	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	414-415	270-271	3479	IGF1	Gene	270	271	9	D003643	death|death	Disease	47:414	48:415	1:12	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	414-415	379-380	3552	IL1A|IL1A|IL1A	Gene	218:370:379	219:371:380	7:11:11	D003643	death|death	Disease	47:414	48:415	1:12	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	414-415	279-280	3566	IL4R	Gene	279	280	9	D003643	death|death	Disease	47:414	48:415	1:12	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	414-415	252-253	4524	MTHFR	Gene	252	253	8	D003643	death|death	Disease	47:414	48:415	1:12	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	414-415	254-255	4846	NOS3	Gene	254	255	8	D003643	death|death	Disease	47:414	48:415	1:12	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	414-415	232-233	5329	PLAUR	Gene	232	233	7	D003643	death|death	Disease	47:414	48:415	1:12	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	209-210	207-208	1277	COL1A1|COL1A1	Gene	209:367	210:368	7:11	D011225	pre -

17186461	Mutations of presenilin genes in dilated cardiomyopathy and heart failure .|Two common disorders of the elderly are heart failure and Alzheimer disease ( AD ) .|Heart failure usually results from dilated cardiomyopathy ( DCM ) .|DCM of unknown cause in families has recently been shown to result from genetic disease , highlighting newly discovered disease mechanisms .|AD is the most frequent neurodegenerative disease of older Americans .|Familial AD is caused most commonly by presenilin 1 ( PSEN1 ) or presenilin 2 ( PSEN2 ) mutations , a discovery that has greatly advanced the field .|The presenilins are also expressed in the heart and are critical to cardiac development .|We hypothesized that mutations in presenilins may also be associated with DCM and that their discovery could provide new insight into the pathogenesis of DCM and heart failure .|A total of 315 index patients with DCM were evaluated for sequence variation in PSEN1 and PSEN2 .|Families positive for mutations underwent additional clinical , genetic , and functional studies .|A novel PSEN1 missense mutation ( Asp333Gly ) was identified in one family , and a single PSEN2 missense mutation ( Ser130Leu ) was found in two other families .|Both mutations segregated with DCM and heart failure .|The PSEN1 mutation was associated with complete penetrance and progressive disease that resulted in the necessity of cardiac transplantation or in death .|The PSEN2 mutation showed partial penetrance , milder disease , and a more favorable prognosis .|Calcium signaling was altered in cultured skin fibroblasts from PSEN1 and PSEN2 mutation carriers .|These data indicate that PSEN1 and PSEN2 mutations are associated with DCM and heart failure and implicate novel mechanisms of myocardial disease

17203304	Evidence for epistasis between SLC6A4 and ITGB3 in autism etiology and in the determination of platelet serotonin levels .|Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder of unclear etiology .|The consistent finding of platelet hyperserotonemia in a proportion of patients and its heritability within affected families suggest that genes involved in the serotonin system play a role in this disorder .|The role in autism etiology of seven candidate genes in the serotonin metabolic and neurotransmission pathways and mapping to autism linkage regions ( SLC6A4 , HTR1A , HTR1D , HTR2A , HTR5A , TPH1 and ITGB3 ) was analyzed in a sample of 186 nuclear families .|The impact of interactions among these genes in autism was assessed using the multifactor - dimensionality reduction ( MDR ) method in 186 patients and 181 controls .|We further evaluated whether the effect of specific gene variants or gene interactions associated with autism etiology might be mediated by their influence on serotonin levels , using the quantitative transmission disequilibrium test ( QTDT ) and the restricted partition method ( RPM ) , in a sample of 109 autistic children .|We report a significant main effect of the HTR5A gene in autism ( P = 0 . 0088 ) , and a significant three - locus model comprising a synergistic interaction between the ITGB3 and SLC6A4 genes with an additive effect of HTR5A ( P < 0 . 0010 ) .|In addition to the previously reported contribution of SLC6A4 , we found significant associations of ITGB3 haplotypes with serotonin level distribution ( P = 0 . 0163 ) .|The most significant models contributing to serotonin distribution were found for interactions between TPH1 rs4537731 and SLC6A4 haplotypes ( P = 0 . 002 ) and between HTR1D rs6300 and SLC6A4 haplotypes ( P = 0 . 013 ) .|In addition to the significant independent effects , evidence for interaction between SLC6A4 and ITGB3 markers was also found .|The overall results implicate SLC6A4 and ITGB3 gene interactions in autism etiology and in serotonin level determination , providing evidence for a common underlying genetic mechanism and a molecular explanation for the association of platelet hyperserotonemia with autism

18806915	Association of the s allele of the 5 - HTTLPR with neuroticism - related traits and temperaments in a psychiatrically healthy population .|INTRODUCTION : Research concerning the genetic background of traits , temperaments and psychiatric disorders has been rapidly expanding .|One of the most frequently studied genetic polymorphisms in the background of psychological and psychiatric phenomena is the 5 - HTTLPR polymorphism of the serotonin transporter gene which has earlier been found to be associated with neuroticism and neuroticism - related traits and disorders .|However , both the neuroticism trait and psychiatric disorders are complex and composed of several subfacets .|The aim of our study was to investigate the association of the 5 - HTTLPR polymorphism with several smaller , distinct and better characterisable phenomena related to the neuroticism trait .|METHODS : 169 healthy females participated in the study .|All participants completed the Buss - Durkee Hostility Inventory ( BDHI ) , the State - Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) , The Zung Self - rating Depression Scale ( ZSDS ) , the Beck Hopelessness Scale , the SCL - 51 , the Temperament and Character Inventory ( TCI ) and the Temperament Evaluation of Memphis , Pisa , Paris and San Diego ( TEMPS - A ) questionnaire .|All subjects were genotyped for the 5 - HTTLPR using PCR .|Data were analysed with ANOVA and MANCOVA with age as a covariate .|RESULTS : We found that the presence of the s allele was significantly associated with anxiety , depression , hopelessness , guilt , hostility , aggression , presence of neurotic symptoms , self - directedness and affective temperaments carrying a depressive component even when controlling for age .|CONCLUSIONS : Our study is the first that confirms that traits and characteristics related to neuroticism , such as increased anxiety , depression , hopelessness , somatization , feeling of guilt , hostility , aggression , lack of self - directedness and affective temperament are consistently and independently associated with the 5 - HTTLPR polymorphism of the serotonin transporter gene .|Our study therefore suggests that neuroticism can be considered a unified construct not only from a phenotypical but also from a genetic point of view and 5HTTLPR can be considered one component of its polygenic background .|Our results thus yield further insight into the role of the 5 - HTTLPR in the background of neuroticism and neuroticism - related psychiatric disorders .	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	11-12	7-10	6532	5 - HTTLPR|5 - HTTLPR|serotonin transporter|5 - HTTLPR|5 - HTTLPR|5 - HTTLPR|serotonin transporter|5 - HTTLPR	Gene	7:60:66:116:223:341:347:399	10:63:68:119:226:344:349:402	0:2:2:4:7:10:10:12	C564323	neuroticism|neuroticism|neuroticism|neuroticism|neuroticism|neuroticism|neuroticism|neuroticism|neuroticism	Disease	11:78:80:91:132:305:356:406:408	12:79:81:92:133:306:357:407:409	0:2:2:3:4:10:11:12:12	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	341-344	310-311	6532	5 - HTTLPR|5 - HTTLPR|serotonin transporter|5 - HTTLPR|5 - HTTLPR|5 - HTTLPR|serotonin transporter|5 - HTTLPR	Gene	7:60:66:116:223:341:347:399	10:63:68:119:226:344:349:402	0:2:2:4:7:10:10:12	D001008	Anxiety|anxiety|anxiety	Disease	162:257:310	163:258:311	6:9:10	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	60-63	56-57	6532	5 - HTTLPR|5 - HTTLPR|serotonin transporter|5 - HTTLPR|5 - HTTLPR|5 - HTTLPR|serotonin transporter|5 - HTTLPR	Gene	7:60:66:116:223:341:347:399	10:63:68:119:226:344:349:402	0:2:2:4:7:10:10:12	D001523	psychiatric disorders|psychiatric|psychiatric disorders|aggression|aggression|psychiatric disorders	Disease	35:56:94:267:324:411	37:57:96:268:325:413	1:2:3:9:10:12	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	341-344	312-313	6532	5 - HTTLPR|5 - HTTLPR|serotonin transporter|5 - HTTLPR|5 - HTTLPR|5 - HTTLPR|serotonin transporter|5 - HTTLPR	Gene	7:60:66:116:223:341:347:399	10:63:68:119:226:344:349:402	0:2:2:4:7:10:10:12	D003866	Depression|depression|depressive|depression	Disease	173:259:282:312	174:260:283:313	6:9:9:10	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	271-273	223-226	6532	5 - HTTLPR|5 - HTTLPR|serotonin transporter|5 - HTTLPR|5 - HTTLPR|5 - HTTLPR|serotonin transporter|5 - HTTLPR	Gene	7:60:66:116:223:341:347:399	10:63:68:119:226:344:349:402	0:2:2:4:7:10:10:12	D009497	neurotic symptoms	Disease	271	273	9

19058785	Association between sodium - and potassium - activated adenosine triphosphatase alpha isoforms and bipolar disorders .|BACKGROUND : The sodium - and potassium - activated adenosine triphosphatase ( Na + , K + - ATPase ) is a major plasma membrane transporter for sodium and potassium .|We recently suggested that bipolar disorders ( BD ) may be associated with alterations in brain Na + , K + - ATPase .|We further conjectured that the differences in Na + , K + - ATPase in BD patients could result partially from genetic variations in Na + , K + - ATPase alpha isoforms .|METHODS : To test our hypothesis , we undertook a comprehensive study of 13 tagged single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) across the three genes of the brain alpha isoforms of Na + , K + - ATPase ( ATP1A1 , ATP1A2 , and ATP1A3 , which encode the three alpha isoforms , alpha1 , alpha2 , and alpha3 , respectively ) identified using HapMap data and the Haploview algorithm .|Altogether , 126 subjects diagnosed with BD from 118 families were genotyped ( parents and affected siblings ) .|Both individual SNPs and haplotypes were tested for association using family - based association tests as provided in the UNPHASED and PBAT set of programs .|RESULTS : Significant nominal association with BD was observed for six single SNPs ( alpha1 : rs11805078 ; alpha2 : rs2070704 , rs1016732 , rs2854248 , and rs2295623 ; alpha3 : rs919390 ) in the three genes of Na + , K + - ATPase alpha isoforms .|Haplotype analysis of the alpha2 isoform ( ATP1A2 gene ) showed a significant association with two loci haplotypes with BD ( rs2295623 : rs2070704 ; global p value = . 0198 , following a permutation test ) .|CONCLUSIONS : This study demonstrates for the first time that genetic variations in Na + , K + - ATPase are associated with BD , suggesting a role of this enzyme in the etiology of this disease .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	235-236	227-228	146	alpha1|alpha1	Gene	158:235	159:236	4:7	D001714	bipolar disorders|bipolar disorders|BD|BD|BD|BD|BD|BD	Disease	13:51:54:86:182:227:288:330	15:53:55:87:183:228:289:331	0:2:2:3:5:7:8:9	1:GDA:2	R2L	CROSS	182-183	144-145	476	ATP1A1	Gene	144	145	4	D001714	bipolar disorders|bipolar disorders|BD|BD|BD|BD|BD|BD	Disease	13:51:54:86:182:227:288:330	15:53:55:87:183:228:289:331	0:2:2:3:5:7:8:9	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	288-289	276-277	477	ATP1A2|ATP1A2	Gene	146:276	147:277	4:8	D001714	bipolar disorders|bipolar disorders|BD|BD|BD|BD|BD|BD	Disease	13:51:54:86:182:227:288:330	15:53:55:87:183:228:289:331	0:2:2:3:5:7:8:9	1:GDA:2	R2L	CROSS	182-183	149-150	478	ATP1A3	Gene	149	150	4	D001714	bipolar disorders|bipolar disorders|BD|BD|BD|BD|BD|BD	Disease	13:51:54:86:182:227:288:330	15:53:55:87:183:228:289:331	0:2:2:3:5:7:8:9
19058873	Polymorphisms in the Caspase7 gene and the risk of lung cancer .|BACKGROUND : Caspase7 ( CASP7 ) is an executioner CASP that conducted a coordinated program of proteolysis that results in the destruction of critical cell structures , and it plays an important role in the development and progression of cancer .|The purpose of this study is to comprehensively evaluate potential functional polymorphisms in the CASP7 gene in relation to the risk of lung cancer .|METHODS : We first captured seven single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) in the regulating region , exons and exon - intron boundaries of the CASP7 gene using public database and then determined their frequencies in 27 healthy Korean individuals .|Next , we examined four SNPs ( rs12415607g .

19061983	A missense mutation in SLC33A1 , which encodes the acetyl - CoA transporter , causes autosomal - dominant spastic paraplegia ( SPG42 ) .|Hereditary spastic paraplegias ( HSPs ) , characterized by progressive and bilateral spasticity of the legs , are usually caused by developmental failure or degeneration of motor axons in the corticospinal tract .|There are considerable interfamilial and intrafamilial variations in age at onset and severity of spasticity .|Genetic studies also showed that there are dozens of genetic loci , on multiple chromosomes , that are responsible for HSPs .|Through linkage study of a pedigree of HSP with autosomal - dominant inheritance , we mapped the causative gene to 3q24 - q26 .|Screening of candidate genes revealed that the HSP is caused by a missense mutation in the gene for acetyl - CoA transporter ( SLC33A1 ) .|It is predicted that the missense mutation , causing the change of the highly conserved serine to arginine at the codon 113 ( p .|S113R ) , disrupts the second transmembrane domain in the transporter and reverses the orientation of all of the descending domains .|Knockdown of Slc33a1 in zebrafish caused a curve - shaped tail and defective axon outgrowth from the spinal cord .|Although the wild - type human SLC33A1 was able to rescue the phenotype caused by Slc33a1 knockdown in zebrafish , the mutant SLC33A1 ( p .

19141695	Prolonged saturated fat - induced , glucose - dependent insulinotropic polypeptide elevation is associated with adipokine imbalance and liver injury in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis : dysregulated enteroadipocyte axis as a novel feature of fatty liver .|BACKGROUND : Genetic and acquired mechanisms underlying the association of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease ( NAFLD ) with diabetes are unknown .|Glucose - dependent insulinotropic polypeptide ( GIP ) was recently linked to adipocyte metabolism and obesity - related metabolic disorders , including NAFLD , induced by an excess of saturated fatty acids ( SFAs ) , but its role in vivo , as well as underlying mechanisms , is unknown .|We hypothesized that altered GIP secretion may contribute to the pathogenesis of NAFLD .|OBJECTIVE : We assessed GIP response to SFA ingestion and its effect on glucose and lipid metabolism and on liver injury in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis ( NASH ) .|DESIGN : Thirty - two nonobese , nondiabetic patients with NASH and 32 healthy controls matched for age , body mass index , and sex underwent a 7 - d dietary record , an oral - glucose - tolerance test ( OGTT ) , and a high - fat - load test .|OGTT - derived indexes of glucose homeostasis were calculated ; circulating lipoproteins , total antioxidant status , GIP , adiponectin , resistin , and cytokeratin - 18 fragments ( markers of hepatocyte apoptosis ) after a high - fat meal were assessed .|All subjects were genotyped for transcription factor 7 - like 2 ( TCF7L2 ) polymorphism .|RESULTS : Patients with NASH exhibited a prolonged GIP elevation after fat ingestion .|GIP response correlated directly with hepatic steatosis , postprandial resistin , and free fatty acid ( FFA ) increase and inversely with beta cell function and incretin effect .|Dietary polyunsaturated : saturated fatty acid ratio and TCF7L2 polymorphism independently predicted postprandial GIP response .|Cytokeratin - 18 fragments increased significantly postprandially in both groups but more consistently in patients with NASH ; their increase was predicted by postprandial adiponectin and FFA responses .|CONCLUSIONS : GIP response to SFA ingestion is prolonged in nondiabetic patients with NASH and is correlated with liver disease , an unfavorable dynamic adipokine profile , and beta cell dysfunction , which provides a rationale for GIP antagonism in these subjects .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	24-27	6-11	2695	glucose -

95 % CI , 0 . 25 to 0 . 99 ) .|CONCLUSION : These results suggest that common genetic variations in this pathway modulate clinical outcomes in patients who undergo chemoradiotherapy .|With further validation , these results may be used to build a model of individualized therapy for the selection of the optimal chemotherapeutic regimen .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	130-131	101-102	207	AKT|akt|AKT|AKT1|AKT1|AKT|AKT1|AKT1	Gene	8:47:54:130:171:228:281:339	9:48:55:131:172:229:282:340	0:1:1:3:4:5:8:10	D000230	adenocarcinoma	Disease	101	102	2	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	132-133	101-102	208	AKT2|AKT2|AKT2|AKT2	Gene	132:173:283:317	133:174:284:318	3:4:8:10	D000230	adenocarcinoma	Disease	101	102	2	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	138-139	101-102	21977	mTOR|mTOR|mTOR	Gene	10:63:138	11:64:139	0:1:3	D000230	adenocarcinoma	Disease	101	102	2	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	135-136	101-102	2475	mammalian target of rapamycin|FRAP1|FRAP1|FRAP1|FRAP1	Gene	58:135:286:298:319	62:136:287:299:320	1:3:8:9:10	D000230	adenocarcinoma	Disease	101	102	2	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	126-127	101-102	5290	PI3K|PIK3CA	Gene	4:126	5:127	0:3	D000230	adenocarcinoma	Disease	101	102	2	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	101-102	34-35	5295	phosphoinositide - 3 - kinase|PI3K	Gene	28:34	33:35	1:1	D000230	adenocarcinoma	Disease	101	102	2	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	128-129	101-102	5728	PTEN|PTEN|PTEN|PTEN	Gene	6:42:128:240	7:43:129:241	0:1:3:6	D000230	adenocarcinoma	Disease	101	102	2	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	130-131	103-106	207	AKT|akt|AKT|AKT1|AKT1|AKT|AKT1|AKT1	Gene	8:47:54:130:171:228:281:339	9:48:55:131:172:229:282:340	0:1:1:3:4:5:8:10	D002294	squamous cell carcinoma	Disease	103	106	2	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	132-133	103-106	208	AKT2|AKT2|AKT2|AKT2	Gene	132:173:283:317	133:174:284:318	3:4:8:10	D002294	squamous cell carcinoma	Disease	103	106	2	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	138-139	103-106	21977	mTOR|mTOR|mTOR	Gene	10:63:138	11:64:139	0:1:3	D002294	squamous cell carcinoma	Disease	103	106	2	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	135-136	103-106	2475	mammalian target of rapamycin|FRAP1|FRAP1|FRAP1|FRAP1	Gene	58:135:286:298:319	62:136:287:299:320	1:3:8:9:10	D002294	squamous cell carcinoma	Disease	103	106	2	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	126-127	103-106	5290	PI3K|PIK3CA	Gene	4:126	5:127	0:3	D002294	squamous cell carcinoma	Disease	103	106	2	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	103-106	34-35	5295	phosphoinositide - 3 - kinase|PI3K	Gene	28:34	33:35	1:1	D002294	squamous cell carcinoma	Disease	103	106	2	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	128-129	103-106	5728	PTEN|PTEN|PTEN|PTEN	Gene	6:42:128:240	7:43:129:241	0:1:3:6	D002294	squamous cell carcinoma	Disease	103	106	2	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	339-340	311-312	207	AKT|akt|AKT|AKT1|AKT1|AKT|AKT1|AKT1	Gene	8:47:54:130:171:228:281:339	9:48:55:131:172:229:282:340	0:1:1:3:4:5:8:10	D003643	death	Disease	311	312	9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	317-318	311-312	208	AKT2|AKT2|AKT2|AKT2	Gene	132:173:283:317	133:174:284:318	3:4:8:10	D003643	death	Disease	311	312	9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	311-312	138-139	21977	mTOR|mTOR|mTOR	Gene	10:63:138	11:64:139	0:1:3	D003643	death	Disease	311	312	9	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	319-320	311-312	2475	mammalian target of rapamycin|FRAP1|FRAP1|FRAP1|FRAP1	Gene	58:135:286:298:319	62:136:287:299:320	1:3:8:9:10	D003643	death	Disease	311	312	9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	311-312	126-127	5290	PI3K|PIK3CA	Gene	4:126	5:127	0:3	D003643	death	Disease	311	312	9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	311-312	34-35	5295	phosphoinositide - 3 - kinase|PI3K	Gene	28:34	33:35	1:1	D003643	death	Disease	311	312	9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	311-312	240-241	5728	PTEN|PTEN|PTEN|PTEN	Gene	6:42:128:240	7:43:129:241	0:1:3:6	D003643	death	Disease	311	312	9	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	18-20	8-9	207	AKT|akt|AKT|AKT1|AKT1|AKT|AKT1|AKT1	Gene	8:47:54:130:171:228:281:339	9:48:55:131:172:229:282:340	0:1:1:3:4:5:8:10	D004938	esophageal cancer|esophageal cancer	Disease	18:97	20:99	0:2	1:GDA:2	R2L	CROSS	132-133	97-99	208	AKT2|AKT2|AKT2|AKT2	Gene	132:173:283:317	133:174:284:318	3:4:8:10	D004938	esophageal cancer|esophageal cancer	Disease	18:97	20:99	0:2	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	18-20	10-11	21977	mTOR|mTOR|mTOR	Gene	10:63:138	11:64:139	0:1:3	D004938	esophageal cancer|esophageal cancer	Disease	18:97	20:99	0:2	1:GDA:2	R2L	CROSS	135-136	97-99	2475	mammalian target of rapamycin|FRAP1|FRAP1|FRAP1|FRAP1	Gene	58:135:286:298:319	62:136:287:299:320	1:3:8:9:10	D004938	esophageal cancer|esophageal cancer	Disease	18:97	20:99	0:2	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	18-20	4-5	5290	PI3K|PIK3CA	Gene	4:126	5:127	0:3	D004938	esophageal cancer|esophageal cancer	Disease	18:97	20:99	0:2	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	28-33	18-20	5295	phosphoinositide - 3 - kinase|PI3K	Gene	28:34	33:35	1:1	D004938	esophageal cancer|esophageal cancer	Disease	18:97	20:99	0:2	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	18-20	6-7	5728	PTEN|PTEN|PTEN|PTEN	Gene	6:42:128:240	7:43:129:241	0:1:3:6	D004938	esophageal cancer|esophageal cancer	Disease	18:97	20:99	0:2

19687159	Interleukin 18 gene promoter polymorphism : a link between hypertension and pre - hospital sudden cardiac death : the Helsinki Sudden Death Study .|AIMS : The interleukin 18 ( IL - 18 ) gene has a single nucleotide promoter region ( - 137 ) G - to - C polymorphism ( rs187238 ) which leads to attenuated transcriptional activity of the gene and to lower production of pro - atherogenic IL - 18 .|The C allele of this polymorphism is associated with a lower risk of sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) .|We examined the process by which this polymorphism alters the risk of SCD and coronary artery disease ( CAD ) by analysing the interactions between this polymorphism and environmental factors .|METHODS AND RESULTS : TaqMan 5 ' nuclease assay was used to genotype the study population of the Helsinki Sudden Death Study , comprising medicolegal autopsies of 700 men .|According to adjusted logistic regression analysis , there was a significant interaction between IL - 18 genotype and hypertension impacting on the risk of SCD due to coronary heart disease ( CHD ) ( P = 0 . 011 ) and the severity of autopsy - verified CAD ( P = 0 . 026 ) .|Among GG homozygotes , hypertension was a major risk factor for SCD due to CHD [ adjusted odds ratio ( OR ) 3 . 75 with 95 % CI 1 . 78 - 7 . 91 , P < 0 . 001 ] and hypertension also associated with larger coronary atherosclerotic plaque areas ( P = 0 . 002 ) and the occurrence of complicated plaques ( adjusted OR 8 . 38 with 95 % CI 2 . 39 -

19723304	Frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms in NOD1 gene of ulcerative colitis patients : a case - control study in the Indian population .|BACKGROUND : Epidemiological studies have provided enough evidence that genetic factors have an important role in determining susceptibility to IBD .|The most significant finding in the IBD research has been identification of mutations in the gene that encodes Nod2 ( nucleotide - binding oligomerization domain 2 ) protein in a subgroup of patients with Crohn 's disease .|However , a very similar gene encoding Nod1 protein still has not been well documented for its association with ulcerative colitis patients .|Detection of polymorphism in NOD1 gene using SNP analysis has been attempted in the present study .|We evaluated frequency and significance of mutations present in the nucleotide - binding domain ( NBD ) of NOD1 gene in context to Indian population .|METHODS : A total of 95 patients with ulcerative colitis and 102 controls enrolled in the Gastroenterology department of All India Institute of Medical Sciences , New Delhi were screened for SNPs by DHPLC and RFLP techniques .|Exon 6 locus in the NBD domain of NOD1 gene was amplified and sequenced .|Genotype and allele frequencies of the patients and controls were calculated by the Pearson 's chi2 test , Fisher 's exact test and ANOVA with Bonferroni 's correction using SPSS software version 12 .|RESULTS : We have demonstrated DHPLC screening technique to show the presence of SNPs in Exon 6 locus of NBD domain of NOD1 gene .|The DHPLC analysis has proven suitable for rapid detection of base pair changes .|The data was validated by sequencing of clones and subsequently by RFLP analysis .|Analyses of SNP data revealed 3 significant mutations ( W219R , p = 0 . 002 ; L349P , p = 0 . 002 and L370R , p = 0 . 039 ) out of 5 in the Exon 6 locus of NBD domain of the gene that encompasses ATP and Mg2 + binding sites .|No significant association was observed within different sub phenotypes .|CONCLUSION : We propose that the location of mutations in the Exon 6 spanning the ATP and Mg2 + binding site of NBD in NOD1 gene may affect the process of oligomerization and subsequent function of the LRR domain .|Further studies are been conducted at the protein level to prove this possibility .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	42-43	6-7	10392	NOD1|Nod1|NOD1|NOD1|NOD1|NOD1|NOD1	Gene	6:89:109:140:194:257:378	7:90:110:141:195:258:379	0:3:4:5:7:9:14	C535541	IBD|IBD	Disease	42:50	43:51	1:2	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	62-63	50-51	64127	Nod2|nucleotide - binding oligomerization domain 2	Gene	62:64	63:70	2:2	C535541	IBD|IBD	Disease	42:50	43:51	1:2	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	9-11	6-7	10392	NOD1|Nod1|NOD1|NOD1|NOD1|NOD1|NOD1	Gene	6:89:109:140:194:257:378	7:90:110:141:195:258:379	0:3:4:5:7:9:14	D003093	ulcerative colitis|ulcerative colitis|ulcerative colitis	Disease	9:101:156	11:103:158	0:3:6	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	101-103	64-70	64127	Nod2|nucleotide - binding oligomerization domain 2	Gene	62:64	63:70	2:2	D003093	ulcerative colitis|ulcerative colitis|ulcerative colitis	Disease	9:101:156	11:103:158	0:3:6	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	89-90	78-81	10392	NOD1|Nod1|NOD1|NOD1|NOD1|NOD1|NOD1	Gene	6:89:109:140:194:257:378	7:90:110:141:195:258:379	0:3:4:5:7:9:14	D003424	Crohn 's disease	Disease	78	81	2	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	78-81	64-70	64127	Nod2|nucleotide - binding oligomerization domain 2	Gene	62:64	63:70	2:2	D003424	Crohn 's disease	Disease	78	81	2

19773262	Diamond - Blackfan anemia : genotype - phenotype correlations in Italian patients with RPL5 and RPL11 mutations .|BACKGROUND : Diamond - Blackfan anemia is a rare , pure red blood cell aplasia of childhood due to an intrinsic defect in erythropoietic progenitors .|About 40 % of patients display various malformations .|Anemia is corrected by steroid treatment in more than 50 % of cases ; non - responders need chronic transfusions or stem cell transplantation .|Defects in the RPS19 gene , encoding the ribosomal protein S19 , are the main known cause of Diamond - Blackfan anemia and account for more than 25 % of cases .|Mutations in RPS24 , RPS17 , and RPL35A described in a minority of patients show that Diamond - Blackfan anemia is a disorder of ribosome biogenesis .|Two new genes ( RPL5 , RPL11 ) , encoding for ribosomal proteins of the large subunit , have been reported to be involved in a considerable percentage of patients .|DESIGN AND METHODS : In this genotype - phenotype analysis we screened the coding sequence and intron - exon boundaries of RPS14 , RPS16 , RPS24 , RPL5 , RPL11 , and RPL35A in 92 Italian patients with Diamond - Blackfan anemia who were negative for RPS19 mutations .|RESULTS : About 20 % of the patients screened had mutations in RPL5 or RPL11 , and only 1 . 6 % in RPS24 .|All but three mutations that we report here are new mutations .|No mutations were found in RPS14 , RPS16 , or RPL35A .|Remarkably , we observed a higher percentage of somatic malformations in patients with RPL5 and RPL11 mutations .|A close association was evident between RPL5 mutations and craniofacial malformations , and between hand malformations and RPL11 mutations .|CONCLUSIONS : Mutations in four ribosomal proteins account for around 50 % of all cases of Diamond - Blackfan anemia in Italian patients .|Genotype - phenotype data suggest that mutation screening should begin with RPL5 and RPL11 in patients with Diamond - Blackfan anemia with malformations .	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	279-280	275-276	6125	RPL5|RPL5|RPL5|RPL5|RPL5|RPL5|RPL5	Gene	13:141:195:229:279:290:339	14:142:196:230:280:291:340	0:6:7:8:11:12:14	D000014	display various malformations|malformations|malformations|malformations|malformations	Disease	49:275:294:299:350	52:276:295:300:351	2:11:12:12:14	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	301-302	299-300	6135	RPL11|RPL11|RPL11|RPL11|RPL11|RPL11|RPL11	Gene	15:143:197:231:281:301:341	16:144:198:232:282:302:342	0:6:7:8:11:12:14	D000014	display various malformations|malformations|malformations|malformations|malformations	Disease	49:275:294:299:350	52:276:295:300:351	2:11:12:12:14	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	275-276	264-265	6165	RPL35A|RPL35A|RPL35A	Gene	117:200:264	118:201:265	5:7:10	D000014	display various malformations|malformations|malformations|malformations|malformations	Disease	49:275:294:299:350	52:276:295:300:351	2:11:12:12:14	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	275-276	259-260	6208	RPS14|RPS14	Gene	189:259	190:260	7:10	D000014	display various malformations|malformations|malformations|malformations|malformations	Disease	49:275:294:299:350	52:276:295:300:351	2:11:12:12:14	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	275-276	261-262	6217	RPS16|RPS16	Gene	191:261	192:262	7:10	D000014	display various malformations|malformations|malformations|malformations|malformations	Disease	49:275:294:299:350	52:276:295:300:351	2:11:12:12:14	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	114-115	49-52	6218	RPS17	Gene	114	115	5	D000014	display various malformations|malformations|malformations|malformations|malformations	Disease	49:275:294:299:350	52:276:295:300:351	2:11:12:12:14	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	81-82	49-52	6223	RPS19|ribosomal protein S19|RPS19	Gene	81:86:214	82:89:215	4:4:7	D000014	display various malformations|malformations|malformations|malformations|malformations	Disease	49:275:294:299:350	52:276:295:300:351	2:11:12:12:14	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	275-276	240-241	6229	RPS24|RPS24|RPS24	Gene	112:193:240	113:194:241	5:7:8	D000014	display various malformations|malformations|malformations|malformations|malformations	Disease	49:275:294:299:350	52:276:295:300:351	2:11:12:12:14	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	53-54	13-14	6125	RPL5|RPL5|RPL5|RPL5|RPL5|RPL5|RPL5	Gene	13:141:195:229:279:290:339	14:142:196:230:280:291:340	0:6:7:8:11:12:14	D000740	Anemia	Disease	53	54	3	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	53-54	15-16	6135	RPL11|RPL11|RPL11|RPL11|RPL11|RPL11|RPL11	Gene	15:143:197:231:281:301:341	16:144:198:232:282:302:342	0:6:7:8:11:12:14	D000740	Anemia	Disease	53	54	3	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	117-118	53-54	6165	RPL35A|RPL35A|RPL35A	Gene	117:200:264	118:201:265	5:7:10	D000740	Anemia	Disease	53	54	3	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	189-190	53-54	6208	RPS14|RPS14	Gene	189:259	190:260	7:10	D000740	Anemia	Disease	53	54	3	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	191-192	53-54	6217	RPS16|RPS16	Gene	191:261	192:262	7:10	D000740	Anemia	Disease	53	54	3	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	114-115	53-54	6218	RPS17	Gene	114	115	5	D000740	Anemia	Disease	53	54	3	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	81-82	53-54	6223	RPS19|ribosomal protein S19|RPS19	Gene	81:86:214	82:89:215	4:4:7	D000740	Anemia	Disease	53	54	3	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	112-113	53-54	6229	RPS24|RPS24|RPS24	Gene	112:193:240	113:194:241	5:7:8	D000740	Anemia	Disease	53	54	3	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	345-349	339-340	6125	RPL5|RPL5|RPL5|RPL5|RPL5|RPL5|RPL5	Gene	13:141:195:229:279:290:339	14:142:196:230:280:291:340	0:6:7:8:11:12:14	D029503	Diamond -

Pro405Leu founder mutations in 153 Dutch families with breast cancer patients and colorectal cancer patients .|Families were classified as polyposis , revised Amsterdam criteria positive ( FCRC - AMS positive ) , revised Amsterdam criteria negative ( FCRC - AMS negative ) , hereditary breast and colorectal cancer ( HBCC ) and non - HBCC breast cancer families .|As anticipated , biallelic MUTYH mutations were identified among 13 % of 15 polyposis families , which was significantly increased compared to the absence of biallelic MUTYH mutations in the population ( P = 0 . 0001 ) .|Importantly , six heterozygous MUTYH mutations were identified among non - polyposis families with breast and colorectal cancer .|These mutations were identified specifically in FCRC - AMS negative and in HBCC breast cancer families ( 11 % of 28 families and 4 % of 74 families , respectively ; P = 0 . 02 for both groups combined vs . controls ) .|Importantly , the 11 % MUTYH frequency among FCRC - AMS negative families was almost fivefold higher than the reported frequencies for FCRC - AMS negative families unselected for the presence of breast cancer patients ( P = 0 . 03 ) .|Together , our results indicate that heterozygous MUTYH mutations are associated with families that include both breast cancer patients and colorectal cancer patients , independent of which tumour type is more prevalent in the family .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	40-42	18-19	4595	MUTYH|MUTYH|MUTYH|MUTYH|MUTYH|MUTYH|MUTYH|MUTYH|MUTYH	Gene	1:18:68:88:163:185:202:267:312	2:19:69:89:164:186:203:268:313	0:1:4:5:7:7:8:10:11	C563365	colorectal adenomas	Disease	40	42	2	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	74-76	68-69	4595	MUTYH|MUTYH|MUTYH|MUTYH|MUTYH|MUTYH|MUTYH|MUTYH|MUTYH	Gene	1:18:68:88:163:185:202:267:312	2:19:69:89:164:186:203:268:313	0:1:4:5:7:7:8:10:11	D001943	breast cancer|breast cancer|breast cancer|breast cancer|hereditary breast and colorectal cancer ( HBCC ) and non - HBCC breast cancer|breast cancer|breast cancer|breast cancer	Disease	8:60:74:107:143:230:294:321	10:62:76:109:157:232:296:323	0:3:4:5:6:9:10:11	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	332-333	312-313	4595	MUTYH|MUTYH|MUTYH|MUTYH|MUTYH|MUTYH|MUTYH|MUTYH|MUTYH	Gene	1:18:68:88:163:185:202:267:312	2:19:69:89:164:186:203:268:313	0:1:4:5:7:7:8:10:11	D009369	tumour	Disease	332	333	11	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	22-26	18-19	4595	MUTYH|MUTYH|MUTYH|MUTYH|MUTYH|MUTYH|MUTYH|MUTYH|MUTYH	Gene	1:18:68:88:163:185:202:267:312	2:19:69:89:164:186:203:268:313	0:1:4:5:7:7:8:10:11	D011125	MUTYH - associated polyposis|MAP|MAP|MAP|polyposis|polyposis	Disease	22:27:34:51:119:172	26:28:35:52:120:173	1:1:2:3:6:7	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	207-216	202-203	4595	MUTYH|MUTYH|MUTYH|MUTYH|MUTYH|MUTYH|MUTYH|MUTYH|MUTYH	Gene	1:18:68:88:163:185:202:267:312	2:19:69:89:164:186:203:268:313	0:1:4:5:7:7:8:10:11	D015179	colorectal cancer|colorectal carcinoma|colorectal cancer|colorectal cancer|non - polyposis families with breast and colorectal cancer|colorectal cancer	Disease	11:43:77:111:207:325	13:45:79:113:216:327	0:2:4:5:8:11

20208132	PIDDosome expression and the role of caspase - 2 activation for chemotherapy - induced apoptosis in RCCs .|BACKGROUND : The importance of caspase - 2 activation for mediating apoptosis in cancer is not clear and seems to differ between different tumour types .|Furthermore , only few data have been obtained concerning the expression of caspase - 2 , which can be alternatively spliced into caspase - 2L and caspase - 2S , and the other PIDDosome members PIDD and RAIDD in human tumours in vivo .|We , therefore , investigated their expression in renal cell carcinomas ( RCCs ) of the clear cell type in vivo and analysed the role of caspase - 2 in chemotherapy - induced apoptosis in RCCs in vitro .|METHODS : The analyses were performed by semiquantitative real - time PCR , Western Blot and Caspase - 2 Assay .|RESULTS : Our in vivo results showed an overall decrease in proapoptotic caspase - 2L expression during tumour progression due to an increase in the relative share of caspase - 2S mRNA in total caspase - 2 mRNA expression .|Furthermore , an increase in the expression of PIDD and RAIDD could be observed .|In contrast , antiapoptotic BCL - 2 expression increased only during early tumour stages , whereas expression decreased in pT3 RCCs .|In vitro , caspase - 2 activation in RCC cell lines coincidenced with sensitivity of tumour cells towards Topotecan - induced apoptosis .|However , inhibition of caspase - 2 could not prevent Topotecan - induced apoptosis .|Interestingly , Topotecan - resistance could be overcome by the apoptosis - sensitizing drug HA14 - 1 .|CONCLUSION : Our study confirms the concept of a shift towards a more antiapoptotic transcriptional context during tumour progression in RCCs .|Furthermore , it shows that caspase - 2 participates in chemotherapy - induced apoptosis in RCCs although it is not mandatory for it .|Additionally , inhibition of antiapoptotic BCL - 2 family members might provide a possible way to overcome chemotherapy resistance of RCCs .	1:GDA:2	R2L	CROSS	96-99	79-80	55367	PIDD|PIDD	Gene	79:196	80:197	2:6	D002292	RCCs|renal cell carcinomas|RCCs|RCCs|RCCs|RCC|RCCs|RCCs|RCCs	Disease	16:96:100:123:223:233:301:318:347	17:99:101:124:224:234:302:319:348	0:3:3:3:7:8:11:12:13	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	347-348	332-335	596	BCL - 2|BCL - 2	Gene	207:332	210:335	7:13	D002292	RCCs|renal cell carcinomas|RCCs|RCCs|RCCs|RCC|RCCs|RCCs|RCCs	Disease	16:96:100:123:223:233:301:318:347	17:99:101:124:224:234:302:319:348	0:3:3:3:7:8:11:12:13	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	233-234	228-231	835	caspase - 2|caspase - 2|caspase - 2|caspase - 2|Caspase - 2|caspase - 2|caspase - 2|caspase - 2|caspase - 2	Gene	6:23:56:114:143:182:228:252:308	9:26:59:117:146:185:231:255:311	0:1:2:3:4:5:8:9:12	D002292	RCCs|renal cell carcinomas|RCCs|RCCs|RCCs|RCC|RCCs|RCCs|RCCs	Disease	16:96:100:123:223:233:301:318:347	17:99:101:124:224:234:302:319:348	0:3:3:3:7:8:11:12:13	1:GDA:2	R2L	CROSS	96-99	81-82	8738	RAIDD|RAIDD	Gene	81:198	82:199	2:6	D002292	RCCs|renal cell carcinomas|RCCs|RCCs|RCCs|RCC|RCCs|RCCs|RCCs	Disease	16:96:100:123:223:233:301:318:347	17:99:101:124:224:234:302:319:348	0:3:3:3:7:8:11:12:13	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	84-85	79-80	55367	PIDD|PIDD	Gene	79:196	80:197	2:6	D009369	cancer|tumour|tumours|tumour|tumour|tumour|tumour	Disease	31:41:84:165:215:240:298	32:42:85:166:216:241:299	1:1:2:5:7:8:11	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	215-216	207-210	596	BCL - 2|BCL - 2	Gene	207:332	210:335	7:13	D009369	cancer|tumour|tumours|tumour|tumour|tumour|tumour	Disease	31:41:84:165:215:240:298	32:42:85:166:216:241:299	1:1:2:5:7:8:11	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	31-32	23-26	835	caspase - 2|caspase - 2|caspase - 2|caspase - 2|Caspase - 2|caspase - 2|caspase - 2|caspase - 2|caspase - 2	Gene	6:23:56:114:143:182:228:252:308	9:26:59:117:146:185:231:255:311	0:1:2:3:4:5:8:9:12	D009369	cancer|tumour|tumours|tumour|tumour|tumour|tumour	Disease	31:41:84:165:215:240:298	32:42:85:166:216:241:299	1:1:2:5:7:8:11	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	84-85	81-82	8738	RAIDD|RAIDD	Gene	81:198	82:199	2:6	D009369	cancer|tumour|tumours|tumour|tumour|tumour|tumour	Disease	31:41:84:165:215:240:298	32:42:85:166:216:241:299	1:1:2:5:7:8:11
20211941	Astrocyte - specific overexpression of Nrf2 protects striatal neurons from mitochondrial complex II inhibition .|Nuclear factor E2 - related factor 2 ( Nrf2 ) is a transcription factor that is known to regulate a variety of cytoprotective genes through the antioxidant response element ( ARE ) .|This endogenous response is one of the major pathways by which cells are protected from xenobiotic or innate oxidative insults .|Furthermore , in neural systems , astrocyte - specific activation of Nrf2 is known to protect neurons .|In previous work , our laboratory found that Nrf2 protects from intrastriatal injections of the mitochondrial complex II inhibitor malonate .|Here , we extend these results to show that multiple methods of astrocyte - specific Nrf2 overexpression provide protection from neurotoxicity in vivo .|GFAP - Nrf2 transgenic mice are significantly more resistant to malonate lesioning .|This outcome is associated with an increased basal resistance , but more so , an enhanced Nrf2 response to lesioning that attenuated the ensuing neurotoxicity .|Furthermore , striatal transplantation of neuroprogenitor cells overexpressing Nrf2 that differentiate into astrocytes after grafting also significantly reduced malonate toxicity .|Overall , these data establish that enhanced astrocytic Nrf2 response and Nrf2 preconditioning are both sufficient to protect from acute lesions from mitochondrial complex II inhibition .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	132-133	128-129	2670	GFAP	Gene	132	133	6	D020258	neurotoxicity|neurotoxicity	Disease	128:169	129:170	5:7	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	128-129	123-124	4780	Nrf2|Nuclear factor E2 - related factor 2|Nrf2|Nrf2|Nrf2|Nrf2|Nrf2|Nrf2|Nrf2|Nrf2|Nrf2	Gene	5:15:23:80:95:123:134:161:179:200:203	6:22:24:81:96:124:135:162:180:201:204	0:1:1:3:4:5:6:7:8:9:9	D020258	neurotoxicity|neurotoxicity	Disease	128:169	129:170	5:7	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	190-191	132-133	2670	GFAP	Gene	132	133	6	D064420	toxicity	Disease	190	191	8	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	200-201	190-191	4780	Nrf2|Nuclear factor E2 - related factor 2|Nrf2|Nrf2|Nrf2|Nrf2|Nrf2|Nrf2|Nrf2|Nrf2|Nrf2	Gene	5:15:23:80:95:123:134:161:179:200:203	6:22:24:81:96:124:135:162:180:201:204	0:1:1:3:4:5:6:7:8:9:9	D064420	toxicity	Disease	190	191	8
20220260	Linkage and haplotype analysis for chemokine receptors clustered on chromosome 3p21 . 3 and transmitted in family pedigrees with asthma and atopy .|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES : Genomic scan analyses have suggested that the chemokine receptor cluster ( CCR2 , CCR3 , CCR5 < 300 kb span ) on the short arm of chromosome 3 may contribute to susceptibility to HIV - 1 infection and to the expression of a number of inflammatory diseases .|Two single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNP ) and a deletion in these chemokine receptors have also been found in case - control studies to be associated with susceptibility for asthma and related phenotypes .|We extended these case - control studies by establishing whether these polymorphisms were in linkage and linkage disequilibrium with asthma and related phenotypes using linkage and haplotype analyses .|METHODS : We genotyped 154 nuclear families identified through two child probands with physician - diagnosed asthma ( 453 unrelated individuals ) including 303 unrelated parents and 150 unrelated children .|Atopy was defined as a positive skin prick test ( SPT 3 mm ) to a panel of common inhaled allergens .|RESULTS : From a panel of ten known SNPs , only three polymorphisms : - G190A in CCR2 , - T51C in CCR3 , and a 32 bp deletion in CCR5 were found to occur at clinically relevant frequencies .|All 154 families were used for haplotype analysis but only 12 nuclear families were eligible for linkage analysis .|Both analyses confirmed that the mutations were in linkage with asthma , but not with atopy .|CONCLUSION : The chemokine receptor genes on 3p21 . 3 are significantly plausible candidate genes that can influence the expression of asthma .|The previous association of the CCR532 deletion with protection from childhood asthma appears to be explained by linkage disequilibrium with the - G190A mutation in the CCR2 receptor gene .	1:GDA:2	R2L	CROSS	40-41	19-20	1232	CCR3|CCR3	Gene	40:214	41:215	1:6	D001249	asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma	Disease	19:105:129:155:261:289:302	20:106:130:156:262:290:303	0:2:3:4:8:9:10	1:GDA:2	R2L	CROSS	42-43	19-20	1234	CCR5|CCR5	Gene	42:222	43:223	1:6	D001249	asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma	Disease	19:105:129:155:261:289:302	20:106:130:156:262:290:303	0:2:3:4:8:9:10	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	317-318	302-303	729230	CCR2|CCR2|CCR2	Gene	38:209:317	39:210:318	1:6:10	D001249	asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma	Disease	19:105:129:155:261:289:302	20:106:130:156:262:290:303	0:2:3:4:8:9:10	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	180-182	155-156	8464	SPT 3	Gene	180	182	5	D001249	asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma	Disease	19:105:129:155:261:289:302	20:106:130:156:262:290:303	0:2:3:4:8:9:10	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	60-64	40-41	1232	CCR3|CCR3	Gene	40:214	41:215	1:6	D015658	HIV - 1 infection	Disease	60	64	1	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	60-64	42-43	1234	CCR5|CCR5	Gene	42:222	43:223	1:6	D015658	HIV - 1 infection	Disease	60	64	1	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	60-64	38-39	729230	CCR2|CCR2|CCR2	Gene	38:209:317	39:210:318	1:6:10	D015658	HIV - 1 infection	Disease	60	64	1	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	180-182	60-64	8464	SPT 3	Gene	180	182	5	D015658	HIV - 1 infection	Disease	60	64	1

20237592	Effect of long - term treatment with urocortin on the activity of somatic angiotensin - converting enzyme in spontaneously hypertensive rats .|Our previous acute study on urocortin ( Ucn ) demonstrated that Ucn altered serum and tissue angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE ) activity in rats .|Therefore , the present investigation was designed to explore the effect of long - term treatment with Ucn on somatic ACE ( sACE ) and other components of the renin - angiotensin system ( RAS ) .|After 8 weeks of intravenous administration of Ucn in spontaneously hypertensive rats ( SHR ) , serum and tissue sACE , angiotensin II ( Ang II ) , nitric oxide ( NO ) , Ang - ( 1 - 7 ) , and tissue chymase activities were evaluated .|RT - PCR analysis was performed to determine the quantity of tissue sACE mRNA .|Serum sACE activity was reduced by Ucn , although tissue sACE activity and tissue sACE mRNA were elevated .|Chymase activity was observed to be enhanced by Ucn , whereas the ACE inhibitor enalapril failed to influence chymase .|Serum and tissue Ang II activity was reduced , but NO and Ang - ( 1 - 7 ) production was increased in a concentration - dependent manner after Ucn treatment .|Meanwhile , a significant decrease of the systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) was observed after the long - term Ucn administration , and there was a significant positive correlation ( r2 = 0 . 6993 ) between serum ACE activity and SBP .|Pretreatment with the corticotropin - releasing factor ( CRF ) blocker astressin and the extracellular signal - regulated kinase 1 / 2 ( ERK1 / 2 ) pathway blocker PD98059 abolished these effects of Ucn .|Our findings further support the hypothesis that the changes of sACE activity and the production of other RAS components may play roles in the vasodilatory property of Ucn via the activation of the ERK1 / 2 pathway .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	268-272	96-97	1392	corticotropin -

thus , these polymorphisms may constitute a common etiologic pathway for their development .|In addition , the study replicates a previously reported interaction of IL13 and IL4R polymorphisms in asthma .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	178-179	3-8	3565	interleukin 4 receptor - a	Gene	3	8	0	C566404	atopic	Disease	178	179	7	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	214-215	178-179	3566	IL4R|IL4R|IL4R|IL4R|IL4R|IL4R	Gene	44:75:214:243:252:306	45:76:215:244:253:307	3:5:9:10:10:12	C566404	atopic	Disease	178	179	7	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	178-179	165-166	3596	Interleukin 13|IL13|IL13|IL13|IL13|IL13|IL13|IL13|IL13	Gene	0:42:73:165:191:240:247:267:304	2:43:74:166:192:241:248:268:305	0:3:5:7:8:10:10:11:12	C566404	atopic	Disease	178	179	7	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	12-13	3-8	3565	interleukin 4 receptor - a	Gene	3	8	0	D001249	asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma	Disease	12:49:57:82:111:128:189:205:211:227:230:258:272:277:309	13:50:58:83:112:129:190:206:212:228:231:259:273:278:310	0:3:3:5:5:5:7:8:8:9:9:10:11:11:12	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	214-215	211-212	3566	IL4R|IL4R|IL4R|IL4R|IL4R|IL4R	Gene	44:75:214:243:252:306	45:76:215:244:253:307	3:5:9:10:10:12	D001249	asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma	Disease	12:49:57:82:111:128:189:205:211:227:230:258:272:277:309	13:50:58:83:112:129:190:206:212:228:231:259:273:278:310	0:3:3:5:5:5:7:8:8:9:9:10:11:11:12	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	191-192	189-190	3596	Interleukin 13|IL13|IL13|IL13|IL13|IL13|IL13|IL13|IL13	Gene	0:42:73:165:191:240:247:267:304	2:43:74:166:192:241:248:268:305	0:3:5:7:8:10:10:11:12	D001249	asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma|asthma	Disease	12:49:57:82:111:128:189:205:211:227:230:258:272:277:309	13:50:58:83:112:129:190:206:212:228:231:259:273:278:310	0:3:3:5:5:5:7:8:8:9:9:10:11:11:12	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	10-11	3-8	3565	interleukin 4 receptor - a	Gene	3	8	0	D012220	rhinitis|rhinitis|rhinitis|rhinitis|rhinitis|rhinitis|rhinitis|rhinitis	Disease	10:18:62:80:104:176:181:274	11:19:63:81:105:177:182:275	0:1:4:5:5:7:7:11	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	80-81	75-76	3566	IL4R|IL4R|IL4R|IL4R|IL4R|IL4R	Gene	44:75:214:243:252:306	45:76:215:244:253:307	3:5:9:10:10:12	D012220	rhinitis|rhinitis|rhinitis|rhinitis|rhinitis|rhinitis|rhinitis|rhinitis	Disease	10:18:62:80:104:176:181:274	11:19:63:81:105:177:182:275	0:1:4:5:5:7:7:11	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	80-81	73-74	3596	Interleukin 13|IL13|IL13|IL13|IL13|IL13|IL13|IL13|IL13	Gene	0:42:73:165:191:240:247:267:304	2:43:74:166:192:241:248:268:305	0:3:5:7:8:10:10:11:12	D012220	rhinitis|rhinitis|rhinitis|rhinitis|rhinitis|rhinitis|rhinitis|rhinitis	Disease	10:18:62:80:104:176:181:274	11:19:63:81:105:177:182:275	0:1:4:5:5:7:7:11	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	120-121	3-8	3565	interleukin 4 receptor - a	Gene	3	8	0	D013224	asthmatic	Disease	120	121	5	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	120-121	75-76	3566	IL4R|IL4R|IL4R|IL4R|IL4R|IL4R	Gene	44:75:214:243:252:306	45:76:215:244:253:307	3:5:9:10:10:12	D013224	asthmatic	Disease	120	121	5	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	165-166	120-121	3596	Interleukin 13|IL13|IL13|IL13|IL13|IL13|IL13|IL13|IL13	Gene	0:42:73:165:191:240:247:267:304	2:43:74:166:192:241:248:268:305	0:3:5:7:8:10:10:11:12	D013224	asthmatic	Disease	120	121	5	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	26-28	3-8	3565	interleukin 4 receptor - a	Gene	3	8	0	D029424	airway disease	Disease	26	28	1	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	44-45	26-28	3566	IL4R|IL4R|IL4R|IL4R|IL4R|IL4R	Gene	44:75:214:243:252:306	45:76:215:244:253:307	3:5:9:10:10:12	D029424	airway disease	Disease	26	28	1	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	42-43	26-28	3596	Interleukin 13|IL13|IL13|IL13|IL13|IL13|IL13|IL13|IL13	Gene	0:42:73:165:191:240:247:267:304	2:43:74:166:192:241:248:268:305	0:3:5:7:8:10:10:11:12	D029424	airway disease	Disease	26	28	1

20520848	Genetic markers of adult obesity risk are associated with greater early infancy weight gain and growth .|BACKGROUND : Genome - wide studies have identified several common genetic variants that are robustly associated with adult obesity risk .|Exploration of these genotype associations in children may provide insights into the timing of weight changes leading to adult obesity .|METHODS AND FINDINGS : Children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children ( ALSPAC ) birth cohort were genotyped for ten genetic variants previously associated with adult BMI .|Eight variants that showed individual associations with childhood BMI ( in / near : FTO , MC4R , TMEM18 , GNPDA2 , KCTD15 , NEGR1 , BDNF , and ETV5 ) were used to derive an " obesity - risk - allele score " comprising the total number of risk alleles ( range : 2 - 15 alleles ) in each child with complete genotype data ( n = 7 , 146 ) .|Repeated measurements of weight , length / height , and body mass index from birth to age 11 years were expressed as standard deviation scores ( SDS ) .|Early infancy was defined as birth to age 6 weeks , and early infancy failure to thrive was defined as weight gain between below the 5th centile , adjusted for birth weight .|The obesity - risk - allele score showed little association with birth weight ( regression coefficient : 0 . 01 SDS per allele ; 95 % CI 0 . 00 - 0 . 02 ) , but had an apparently much larger positive effect on early infancy weight gain ( 0 . 119 SDS / allele / year ; 0 . 023 - 0 . 216 ) than on subsequent childhood weight gain ( 0 . 004 SDS / allele / year ;

20622171	Large copy - number variations are enriched in cases with moderate to extreme obesity .|OBJECTIVE : Obesity is an increasingly common disorder that predisposes to several medical conditions , including type 2 diabetes .|We investigated whether large and rare copy - number variations ( CNVs ) differentiate moderate to extreme obesity from never - overweight control subjects .|RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS : Using single nucleotide polymorphism ( SNP ) arrays , we performed a genome - wide CNV survey on 430 obese case subjects ( BMI > 35 kg / m ( 2 ) ) and 379 never - overweight control subjects ( BMI < 25 kg / m ( 2 ) ) .|All subjects were of European ancestry and were genotyped on the Illumina HumanHap550 arrays with 550 , 000 SNP markers .|The CNV calls were generated by PennCNV software .|RESULTS : CNVs > 1 Mb were found to be overrepresented in case versus control subjects ( odds ratio [ OR ] = 1 . 5 [ 95 % CI 0 . 5 - 5 ] ) , and CNVs > 2 Mb were present in 1 . 3 % of the case subjects but were absent in control subjects ( OR = infinity [ 95 % CI 1 . 2 - infinity ] ) .|When focusing on rare deletions that disrupt genes , even more pronounced effect sizes are observed ( OR = 2 . 7 [ 95 % CI 0 . 5 - 27 . 1 ] for CNVs > 1 Mb ) .|Interestingly , obese case subjects who carry these large CNVs have moderately high BMI and do not appear to be extreme cases .|Several CNVs disrupt known candidate genes for obesity , such as a 3 . 3 - Mb deletion disrupting NAP1L5 and a 2 . 1 - Mb deletion disrupting UCP1 and IL15 .|CONCLUSIONS : Our results suggest that large CNVs , especially rare deletions , confer risk of obesity in patients with moderate obesity and that genes impacted by large CNVs represent intriguing candidates for obesity that warrant further study .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	306-307	33-34	266812	NAP1L5	Gene	306	307	9	D003920	diabetes	Disease	33	34	1	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	318-319	33-34	3600	IL15	Gene	318	319	9	D003920	diabetes	Disease	33	34	1	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	316-317	33-34	7350	UCP1	Gene	316	317	9	D003920	diabetes	Disease	33	34	1	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	306-307	294-295	266812	NAP1L5	Gene	306	307	9	D009765	obesity|obesity|obese|obese|obesity|obesity|obesity|obesity	Disease	13:52:84:266:294:336:341:353	14:53:85:267:295:337:342:354	0:2:3:8:9:10:10:10	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	336-337	318-319	3600	IL15	Gene	318	319	9	D009765	obesity|obesity|obese|obese|obesity|obesity|obesity|obesity	Disease	13:52:84:266:294:336:341:353	14:53:85:267:295:337:342:354	0:2:3:8:9:10:10:10	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	336-337	316-317	7350	UCP1	Gene	316	317	9	D009765	obesity|obesity|obese|obese|obesity|obesity|obesity|obesity	Disease	13:52:84:266:294:336:341:353	14:53:85:267:295:337:342:354	0:2:3:8:9:10:10:10
20628598	Common polymorphisms in MTNR1B , G6PC2 and GCK are associated with increased fasting plasma glucose and impaired beta - cell function in Chinese subjects .|BACKGROUND : Previous studies identified melatonin receptor 1B ( MTNR1B ) , islet - specific glucose 6 phosphatase catalytic subunit - related protein ( G6PC2 ) , glucokinase ( GCK ) and glucokinase regulatory protein ( GCKR ) as candidate genes for type 2 diabetes ( T2D ) acting through elevated fasting plasma glucose ( FPG ) .|We examined the associations of the reported common variants of these genes with T2D and glucose homeostasis in three independent Chinese cohorts .|METHODOLOGY / PRINCIPAL FINDINGS : Five single nucleotide polymorphisms ( SNPs ) , MTNR1B rs10830963 , G6PC2 rs16856187 and rs478333 , GCK rs1799884 and GCKR rs780094 , were genotyped in 1644 controls ( 583 adults and 1061 adolescents ) and 1342 T2D patients .|The G - allele of MTNR1B rs10830963 and the C - alleles of both G6PC2 rs16856187 and rs478333 were associated with higher FPG ( 0 . 0034 < P < 6 . 6x10 ( - 5 ) ) in healthy controls .|In addition to our previous report for association with FPG , the A - allele of GCK rs1799884 was also associated with reduced homeostasis model assessment of beta - cell function ( HOMA - B ) ( P = 0 . 0015 ) .|Together with GCKR rs780094 , the risk alleles of these SNPs exhibited dosage effect in their associations with increased FPG ( P = 2 . 9x10 ( -

21285140	Copy number variants in schizophrenia : confirmation of five previous findings and new evidence for 3q29 microdeletions and VIPR2 duplications .|OBJECTIVE : To evaluate previously reported associations of copy number variants ( CNVs ) with schizophrenia and to identify additional associations , the authors analyzed CNVs in the Molecular Genetics of Schizophrenia study ( MGS ) and additional available data .|METHOD : After quality control , MGS data for 3 , 945 subjects with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 3 , 611 screened comparison subjects were available for analysis of rare CNVs ( < 1 % frequency ) .|CNV detection thresholds were chosen that maximized concordance in 151 duplicate assays .|Pointwise and genewise analyses were carried out , as well as analyses of previously reported regions .|Selected regions were visually inspected and confirmed with quantitative polymerase chain reaction .|RESULTS : In analyses of MGS data combined with other available data sets , odds ratios of 7 . 5 or greater were observed for previously reported deletions in chromosomes 1q21 . 1 , 15q13 . 3 , and 22q11 . 21 , duplications in 16p11 . 2 , and exon - disrupting deletions in NRXN1 .|The most consistently supported candidate associations across data sets included a 1 . 6 - Mb deletion in chromosome 3q29 ( 21 genes , TFRC to BDH1 ) that was previously described in a mild - moderate mental retardation syndrome , exonic duplications in the gene for vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 2 ( VIPR2 ) , and exonic duplications in C16orf72 .|The case subjects had a modestly higher genome - wide number of gene - containing deletions ( > 100 kb and > 1 Mb ) but not duplications .|CONCLUSIONS : The data strongly confirm the association of schizophrenia with 1q21 . 1 , 15q13 . 3 , and 22q11 . 21 deletions , 16p11 . 2 duplications , and exonic NRXN1 deletions .|These CNVs , as well as 3q29 deletions , are also associated with mental retardation , autism spectrum disorders , and epilepsy .|Additional candidate genes and regions , including VIPR2 , were identified .|Study of the mechanisms underlying these associations should shed light on the pathophysiology of schizophrenia .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	343-346	261-262	29035	C16orf72	Gene	261	262	7	D002659	autism spectrum

21300947	The brain - derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism and prediction of neural risk for Alzheimer disease .|CONTEXT : The brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) Val66Met ( rs6265 ) polymorphism may predict the risk of Alzheimer disease ( AD ) .|However , genetic association studies of the BDNF gene with AD have produced equivocal results .|Imaging - genetics strategies may clarify the manner in which BDNF gene variation predicts the risk of AD via characterization of its effects on at - risk structures or neural networks susceptible in this disorder .|OBJECTIVE : To determine whether the BDNF Val66Met gene variant interacts with age to predict brain and cognitive measures in healthy volunteers across the adult lifespan in an intermediate phenotype pattern related to AD by examining ( 1 ) cortical thickness , ( 2 ) fractional anisotropy of white matter tracts ( ie , white matter integrity ) , and ( 3 ) episodic memory performance .|DESIGN : A cross - sectional study using genetics , high - resolution magnetic resonance imaging , diffusion tensor imaging , and cognitive testing in healthy individuals spanning the adult lifespan .|SETTING : University hospital .|PARTICIPANTS : A total of 69 healthy volunteers ranging from 19 to 82 years of age .|MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : The BDNF Val66Met genotype , apolipoprotein E genotype , cortical thickness , microstructural integrity of white matter tracts , and episodic memory performance were evaluated .|RESULTS : The BDNF Val66Met polymorphism interacted with age to predict ( 1 ) cortical thickness ( prominently at the entorhinal cortex and temporal gyri ) , ( 2 ) fractional anisotropy of white matter tracts ( prominently at white matter tracts connecting to the medial temporal lobe ) , and ( 3 ) episodic memory performance .|For each of these findings , the pattern was similar : valine / valine individuals in late life were susceptible , and in early adult life , methionine allele carriers demonstrated susceptibility .|CONCLUSIONS : The BDNF gene confers risk in an age - dependent manner on the brain structures and cognitive functions that are consistent with the neural circuitry vulnerable in the earliest stages of AD .|Our novel findings provide convergent evidence in vivo for a BDNF genetic mechanism of susceptibility in an intermediate phenotype related to AD .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	226-228	129-130	348	apolipoprotein E	Gene	226	228	8	D000544	Alzheimer disease|Alzheimer disease|AD|AD|AD|AD|AD|AD	Disease	14:38:41:54:77:129:371:394	16:40:42:55:78:130:372:395	0:1:1:2:3:4:11:12	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	54-55	51-52	627	brain - derived neurotrophic factor|brain - derived neurotrophic factor|BDNF|BDNF|BDNF|BDNF|BDNF|BDNF|BDNF|BDNF	Gene	1:20:26:51:70:102:222:250:341:383	6:25:27:52:71:103:223:251:342:384	0:1:1:2:3:4:8:9:11:12	D000544	Alzheimer disease|Alzheimer disease|AD|AD|AD|AD|AD|AD	Disease	14:38:41:54:77:129:371:394	16:40:42:55:78:130:372:395	0:1:1:2:3:4:11:12	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	231-232	226-228	348	apolipoprotein E	Gene	226	228	8	D009135	thickness|thickness|thickness	Disease	136:231:262	137:232:263	4:8:9	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	231-232	222-223	627	brain - derived neurotrophic factor|brain - derived neurotrophic factor|BDNF|BDNF|BDNF|BDNF|BDNF|BDNF|BDNF|BDNF	Gene	1:20:26:51:70:102:222:250:341:383	6:25:27:52:71:103:223:251:342:384	0:1:1:2:3:4:8:9:11:12	D009135	thickness|thickness|thickness	Disease	136:231:262	137:232:263	4:8:9

22570617	Common variants at 9p21 and 8q22 are associated with increased susceptibility to optic nerve degeneration in glaucoma .|Optic nerve degeneration caused by glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness worldwide .|Patients affected by the normal - pressure form of glaucoma are more likely to harbor risk alleles for glaucoma - related optic nerve disease .|We have performed a meta - analysis of two independent genome - wide association studies for primary open angle glaucoma ( POAG ) followed by a normal - pressure glaucoma ( NPG , defined by intraocular pressure ( IOP ) less than 22 mmHg ) subgroup analysis .|The single - nucleotide polymorphisms that showed the most significant associations were tested for association with a second form of glaucoma , exfoliation - syndrome glaucoma .|The overall meta - analysis of the GLAUGEN and NEIGHBOR dataset results ( 3 , 146 cases and 3 , 487 controls ) identified significant associations between two loci and POAG : the CDKN2BAS region on 9p21 ( rs2157719 [ G ] , OR = 0 . 69 [ 95 % CI 0 . 63 - 0 . 75 ] , p = 1 . 86 10 ) , and the SIX1 / SIX6 region on chromosome 14q23 ( rs10483727 [ A ] , OR = 1 . 32 [ 95 % CI 1 . 21 - 1 . 43 ] , p = 3 . 87 10 ) .|In sub - group analysis two loci were significantly associated with NPG : 9p21 containing the CDKN2BAS gene ( rs2157719 [ G ] , OR = 0 . 58 [ 95 % CI 0 . 50 - 0 . 67 ] , p = 1 . 17 10 ) and a probable regulatory region on 8q22 ( rs284489 [ G ] , OR = 0 . 62 [ 95 % CI 0 . 53 - 0 . 72 ] , p = 8 . 88 10 ) .|Both NPG loci were also nominally associated with a second type of glaucoma , exfoliation syndrome glaucoma ( rs2157719 [ G ] , OR = 0 . 59 [ 95 % CI 0 . 41 -

malignant brain tissue , and between GBM cell lines ( U87 - MG and U373 ) and a control human astrocyte cell line ( NHA ) .|Publicly - available data sets and our own datasets were integrated and normalized using bioinformatics tools to reveal protease and protease inhibitor genes with deregulated expression in both malignant versus non - malignant tissues and cells .|RESULTS : Of the 311 protease genes identified to be differentially expressed in both GBM tissues and cells , 5 genes were highly overexpressed , 2 genes coding for non - peptidase homologues transferrin receptor ( TFRC ) and G protein - coupled receptor 56 ( GPR56 ) , as well as 3 genes coding for the proteases endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 2 ( ERAP2 ) , glutamine - fructose - 6 - phosphate transaminase 2 ( GFPT2 ) and cathepsin K ( CTSK ) , whereas one gene , that of the serine protease carboxypeptidase E ( CPE ) was strongly reduced in expression .|Seventy five protease inhibitor genes were differentially expressed , of which 3 genes were highly overexpressed , the genes coding for stefin B ( CSTB ) , peptidase inhibitor 3 ( PI3 also named elafin ) and CD74 .|Seven out of 8 genes ( except CSTB ) were validated using RT - qPCR in GBM cell lines .|CTSK overexpression was validated using RT - qPCR in GBM tissues as well .|Cathepsin K immunohistochemical staining and western blotting showed that only proteolytically inactive proforms of cathepsin K were overexpressed in GBM tissues and cells .|CONCLUSIONS : The presence of high levels of inactive proforms of cathepsin K in GBM tissues and cells indicate that in GBM the proteolytic / collagenolytic role is not its primary function but it plays rather a different yet unknown role .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	250-252	64-66	1363	carboxypeptidase E	Gene	250	252	5	D001932	brain cancers	Disease	64	66	2	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	285-286	64-66	1476	CSTB|CSTB	Gene	285:307	286:308	6:7	D001932	brain cancers	Disease	64	66	2	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	64-66	7-9	1513	cathepsin K|cathepsin K|CTSK|CTSK|Cathepsin K|cathepsin K|cathepsin K	Gene	7:235:238:320:334:348:369	9:237:239:321:336:350:371	0:5:5:8:9:9:10	D001932	brain cancers	Disease	64	66	2	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	214-218	64-66	64167	endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 2|ERAP2	Gene	214:219	218:220	5:5	D001932	brain cancers	Disease	64	66	2	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	189-191	64-66	7037	transferrin receptor|TFRC	Gene	189:192	191:193	5:5	D001932	brain cancers	Disease	64	66	2	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	195-201	64-66	9289	G protein -

9481718	ApoE polymorphism and albuminuria in diabetes mellitus : a role for LDL in the development of nephropathy in NIDDM ?|BACKGROUND : Chronic hyperglycaemia stands with diabetes duration as the main predicting factor for the development of nephropathy in insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ( IDDM ) .|In contrast , nephropathy in non - insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus ( NIDDM ) presents with a different natural history and , as well as atherosclerosis , can precede diabetes diagnosis and even the onset of patent hyperglycaemia .|The role of lipid abnormalities in this matter remains debated .|METHODS : We studied the prevalence of nephropathy ( N + = urinary albumin excretion rate ( UAE ) > 20 mg / d ) in 134 Caucasian NIDDM patients ranked according to alipoprotein E ( apoE ) genotype ( same distribution in 132 controls ) .|Age , diabetes duration and sex ratio did not differ between N + and N - .|A patient with E2E4 ( n = 1 ) was excluded from the analysis .|RESULTS : The prevalence of nephropathy was significantly reduced in E2 allele carriers ( 36 % , 8 / 22 ) vs 69 % ( 77 / 111 ) in E2 non - carriers ( P < 0 . 01 ) .|Relative risk ( RR ) of E2 carriers developing nephropathy was 0 . 52 ( 95 % CI = 0 . 35 - 0 . 80 ) .|Both groups were comparable in terms of age ( 55 + / - 11 vs 57 + / - 11 years ) , diabetes duration ( 15 + / - 9 vs 14 + / - 10 years ) and prevalence of retinopathy ( 59 vs 48 % ) .|Similar results were observed when patients with diabetes duration longer than 8 years were studied ( n = 94 ) .|CONCLUSIONS : It has been largely established that low - density lipoprotein ( LDL ) - cholesterol level in E2 allele carriers ( whether diabetic or not ) was lower than in E2 non - carriers .|The 2 - fold increase of nephropathy in E2 non - carriers with NIDDM argues for a role for LDL in the development of human nephropathy in NIDDM patients .|This result is in agreement with previous data established both in vitro and in vivo in animal models .|These findings support evidence for the pathogenic and morphologic similarities between kidney disease and atherosclerosis in NIDDM patients .	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	131-133	90-92	348	ApoE|alipoprotein E|apoE	Gene	0:131:134	1:133:135	0:4:4	C562935	lipid abnormalities	Disease	90	92	3	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	3-4	0-1	348	ApoE|alipoprotein E|apoE	Gene	0:131:134	1:133:135	0:4:4	D000419	albuminuria	Disease	3	4	0	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	22-24	0-1	348	ApoE|alipoprotein E|apoE	Gene	0:131:134	1:133:135	0:4:4	D002908	Chronic hyperglycaemia	Disease	22	24	1	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	5-7	0-1	348	ApoE|alipoprotein E|apoE	Gene	0:131:134	1:133:135	0:4:4	D003920	diabetes mellitus|diabetes|diabetes|diabetes|diabetes|diabetes|diabetic	Disease	5:26:77:147:270:304:342	7:27:78:148:271:305:343	0:1:2:5:9:10:11	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	39-43	0-1	348	ApoE|alipoprotein E|apoE	Gene	0:131:134	1:133:135	0:4:4	D003922	insulin dependent diabetes mellitus|IDDM	Disease	39:44	43:45	1:1	1:GDA:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	131-133	126-127	348	ApoE|alipoprotein E|apoE	Gene	0:131:134	1:133:135	0:4:4	D003924	NIDDM|non - insulin - dependent diabetes mellitus|NIDDM|NIDDM|NIDDM|NIDDM|NIDDM	Disease	18:52:60:126:368:382:420	19:59:61:127:369:383:421	0:2:2:4:12:12:14	1:NR:2	R2L	NON-CROSS	16-17	0-1	348	ApoE|alipoprotein E|apoE	Gene	0:131:134	1:133:135	0:4:4	D007674	nephropathy|nephropathy|nephropathy|nephropathy|nephropathy|nephropathy|nephropathy|nephropathy|kidney disease	Disease	16:37:50:105:182:228:361:380:415	17:38:51:106:183:229:362:381:417	0:1:2:4:7:8:12:12:14	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	289-290	134-135	348	ApoE|alipoprotein E|apoE	Gene	0:131:134	1:133:135	0:4:4	D012164	retinopathy	Disease	289	290	9	1:NR:2	R2L	CROSS	131-133	73-74	348	ApoE|alipoprotein E|apoE	Gene	0:131:134	1:133:135	0:4:4	D050197	atherosclerosis|atherosclerosis	Disease	73:418	74:419	2:14
